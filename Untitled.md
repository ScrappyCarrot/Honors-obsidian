[[Temporary Demountable Structures (Institution of Structural Engineers) (Z-Library).pdf#search=This Guide recommends that when considering occupancy, means of access and means of escape, designers and contractors should familiarise themselves with the environmental and technical infrastructure of the site or building in which the temporary structure is to be erected, and its management and information systems. In particular, they should identify safety problems by evaluating the hazards and risks and make sure that temporary structures are properly designed with full regard to their surroundings. In all cases, a written risk assessment, including a fire risk assessment, should be completed.|Temporary Demountable Structures (Institution of Structural Engineers) (Z-Library), p.7]]
