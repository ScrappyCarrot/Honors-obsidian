Tests have to be made in order to determine the fitness of the soil. As this will be a reusable structure, loading to the foundation has to take into account the weakest soil.

The design and selection of a temporary foundation system must address three main areas: geotechnical challenges, structural loading, and regulatory compliance, particularly concerning environmental impacts.

1. Geotechnical Challenges- further explanation on this can be found in [[EUCODE-7-Geotechnical.pdf]]

The Netherlands presents an extremely difficult environment for foundations, largely due to soft, compressible soil, predominantly peat and soft clay. This geotechnical vulnerability necessitates conservative and specialized solutions:

• **Soft Soil and Subsidence:** Large portions of the country are low-lying with soil highly sensitive to fluctuations in land and groundwater levels. This environment dictates an engineering approach that avoids simple shallow footings.

• **Foundation Damage Risk:** Foundation damage (_Funderingsschade_) is an escalating national problem, estimated to affect approximately 425,000 buildings, particularly those founded on older wooden piles or shallow foundations,. The foundation solution chosen must minimize site disturbance to prevent accelerating damage to adjacent permanent properties.

• **Deep Anchoring Imperative:** Foundations must be designed to circumvent the problematic superficial layers and transfer loads safely to deeper, firmer soil strata.

2. Structural Integrity and Loading

Temporary foundations must adhere to the same stringent principles of structural engineering as permanent structures to ensure stability.

• **Load Types:** Design must account for permanent **Dead Loads** (structure self-weight), temporary **Live Loads** (people, equipment), and **Dynamic Environmental Loads** (Wind, Seismic, and Horizontal Soil Pressure).

• **Stability Focus:** For lightweight temporary structures, uplift and overturning due to **Wind Loads** are typically the most critical failure modes, requiring the foundation to provide substantial tensile resistance or significant mass.

• **Design Standards:** Foundation design must comply with European harmonized standards (Eurocodes), which are implemented nationally as **NEN standards**. Specifically, adherence to load combinations for stability checks is necessary,. Prefabricated steel components, such as ground screws or modular steel elements, must adhere to **EN-1090-2** standards for structural reliability.

3. Regulatory and Environmental Compliance

The chosen foundation method must comply with Dutch law, particularly concerning environmental impact and decommissioning.

• **Environmental and Planning Permit:** Activities defined as "earth removal" (_ontgronden_), including digging foundation pits, typically require an environment and planning permit (_omgevingsvergunning_) from the relevant local authority,.

• **Soil Contamination:** If foundation work involves removing contaminated soil, a compulsory preliminary **soil survey** and a formal **remediation report** are required (ensuring compliance with guideline BRL SIKB 7000).

• **Reversibility Advantage:** Using fully reusable, non-invasive metallic systems (like helical anchors) simplifies regulatory closure by minimizing ground disturbance and generally avoiding the need for an _omgevingsvergunning_ for excavation and the associated costly soil remediation protocols,.

| **1. Ground Screw Technology (Helical Anchors)** | Hot-dip galvanized steel anchors twisted deep into the soil using specialized equipment; the helical design compresses the surrounding soil for immediate capacity (up to 150 kN per foundation),,. They are eco-friendly as they require **no concrete** and eliminate curing time,. | **Light-to-Medium Capacity Structures:** Optimal for use on soft, vulnerable soil where minimizing invasion is key. Ideal for modular homes (due to easy disassembly/reinstallation),, and prefabricated lightweight halls or solar structures,. The primary goal is fast, cost-effective setup with clean removal.                                                                                          |
| **2. Deep Anchoring Solutions (Piles/Tubes)**    | Driven steel posts (piles) or customized steel tube constructions, often with welded base plates, used to bypass soft upper strata,. The tubes are typically filled with grout or concrete after driving to increase load-bearing capacity,.                                          | **High-Capacity/Heavy Infrastructure:** Necessary for substantial, verifiable heavy loads like bridge supports or large industrial machinery,. _Example:_ Temporary emergency viaducts installed for the N18 link road project in the Netherlands were supported using **steel tube and sheet piling constructions**,. These components are typically certified to EN-1090-2.                                |
| **3. Non-Penetrating (Ballasted) Systems**       | Foundations relying entirely on mass (e.g., precast concrete blocks or water-filled tanks) for stability, requiring no penetration into the ground surface,.                                                                                                                          | **Paved and Engineered Areas:** Best for sites with pre-existing, robust pavement or hard standings where ground penetration is prohibited or impractical,. _Example:_ HERING's _modula_ temporary platform system uses steel plates on prefabricated foundations, often utilized for makeshift platforms during rail construction or major events, suggesting they rely on previously engineered surfaces,. |
