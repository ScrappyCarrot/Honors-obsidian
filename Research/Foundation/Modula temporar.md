"The temporary platform system **modula® temporär** is a rentable platform that can be used as a temporary construction platform, when dealing with accidents or as an additional temporary stop, such as for trade fairs or events. In addition to the classic replacement construction based on FT foundations, extensions or elevations of existing platforms are also possible as a special solution. In accordance with the system concept, the foundations, platform elements and add-on parts can be combined as desired according to the modular principle."
