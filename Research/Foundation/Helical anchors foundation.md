Helical anchors are basically a big screw. Main advantage is that they can be removed by reversing the torque on them, making the foundation relocatable. Another advantage is that they act as piles, thus are very deep. This diminishes the impact of weak soil which might be a problem in clusters 3,7 and 8 which lie on swampy land.

[[HAI-Engineering-Manual-min.pdf#page=8&annotation=308R|The main purpose of a helical anchor is to transfer structural loads to soil. Nowadays, helical anchors are used for a variety of applications in tension, compression and lateral loads. Typical tension applications of helical anchors include guy anchors for poles and towers, tiebacks for temporary or permanent retaining walls and foundation tiedowns. They can also be used for underpinning to lift sinking foundations, deep foundation elements to support walkways and boardwalks, and tilt-up wall braces. Also, helical anchors have become a foundation of choice for lateral load applications including slope stabilization, poles, towers and fences.]] Depth might be limited by the bending capacity of each screw. Hinged connections might be necessary to not transfer moments. That said 2 failure modes have to be considered, failure of the soil supporting each helix and the failure of the anchor itself.

Formulas for calculations can be found in the document : [[HAI-Engineering-Manual-min.pdf]]

Helical anchors can also be used in tangent with concrete foundations ()
