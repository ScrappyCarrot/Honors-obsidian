This type of foundation relies on weight to provide resistance against uplift and lateral forces.
1. Ballasted systems (non penetrating)- this type of foundation relies solely on weight to resist against forces. The most common materials are concrete blocks, like the system used in [[Gem-Stage tower (floor)]]. This is the most common method and probably the most cost efficient. Steel baskets filled with agregate, and containers filled with water/concerte are also used. These are best used when penetration is prohibited or impractical (this might be relevant to us depending on what the municipality tells us the construction sites will be). 
   Failure modes-Ground failure, since this foundation doesn't penetrate the ground, it relies on distributing the force over weak soil like mud or peat.
2. Concrete based footings- More traditional approach, this casts or drills piles into the ground for heavy load bearing. This might be a good option provided we can remove the foundation and reuse it again (if the loads call for such heavy foundation elements)
3. Submerged concrete blocks with ballast above. We could have big concrete blocks that are underground at around -1.000mm. The primary failure mode of this method would be shear failure of the slab. This, however can be mitigated by increasing the number of contact points to the ground thus decreasing the load on each one, adding rebar and changing dimensions.
