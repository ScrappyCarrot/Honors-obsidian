#### Option A: The "Cassette" System (Best for Demounting)

Do not fill your structure with loose soil. Instead, design your structure to hold **standardized removable trays or pots**.

- **Technique:** Use industrial plastic crates or "trough" planters that fit perfectly into your steel/timber frame.
    
- **Demounting:** When it's time to move, you unclip the irrigation line, lift the crates out by hand, stack them on a pallet, and ship them separately. The structure frames are then empty and light for transport.
    
- **Soil:** Use a lightweight "roof garden substrate" (mostly lava rock/pumice), not potting soil. Regular soil is too heavy (1,500kg/m³) and will compact during transport. Substrate is lighter (800kg/m³) and drains better.
    

#### Option B: The "Hydroponic/Plug" System

- **Technique:** Use hanging textile pockets (like a felt living wall) rather than horizontal beds.
    
- **Demounting:** You can often roll up felt planting systems with the plants still inside (if they are small), or remove the small plastic "plugs" and place them in trays.
    
- **Benefit:** Extremely lightweight and very easy to transport.
