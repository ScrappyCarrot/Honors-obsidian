We need to come up with solutions for a couple of problems like end of life for the whole structure (do we give back the materials or do we make it a permanent structure at some location), biomass during relocation, wildlife solutions.

[[Soil and biomass]]
We can make packets that are demountable and hold vegetation. This limits us at smaller species of plans so no trees 
(WHAT ABOUT ANIMALS THO?????)

[[Materials]]

If we decide on it, we could use lumber trunks (I highly doubt that we can find any in the material passports) both as a structure and a habitat for animals (hard to calculate and code comply this)
