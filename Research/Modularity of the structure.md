### 4. Working with "Uncertainty" in your Proposal

In your 2nd-year project, you don't need to know the _exact_ number of bricks. Instead, design a **"System of Acceptance."**

- **Proposal Tip:** Don't design a bridge that only works with a specific beam. Design a "Clamp System" or a "Generic Grid" that can accept _any_ steel beam between **180mm and 300mm**.
    
- **The "Buffering" Story:** Explain to the municipality that your structure acts as a **"Material Buffer."** You are "storing" the materials from the demolished buildings in the form of a bridge until they are needed for the permanent new towers.
