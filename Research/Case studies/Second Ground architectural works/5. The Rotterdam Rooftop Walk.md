The **Rotterdam Rooftop Walk**, designed by MVRDV for the 2022 Rotterdam Rooftop Days, was a temporary installation that served as a powerful manifesto for urban development. Its architectural value lies not just in its striking orange aesthetic, but in its ability to redefine how we perceive and use vertical space in dense cities.

### 1. The "Second Layer" of the City

The primary architectural value of the project was demonstrating the concept of a **"second ground level."** Rotterdam has approximately **18.5 $\text{km}^2$** of flat, unused rooftops. MVRDV argued that by connecting these spaces, architects can create a new public realm that exists above the noise and traffic of the street. This "superstructure" provides a solution to urban densification without the need for outward expansion into rural area

### 2. Functional Sustainability

The walk was more than a viewpoint; it was a living exhibition of **multifunctional rooftops**. Along the **600-meter** path, the project showcased how roofs can be programmed to address modern urban crises:

- **Blue Roofs:** Systems for rainwater storage to prevent flooding in the low-lying city.
    
- **Green Roofs:** Rewilding efforts and "sky forests" to combat the urban heat island effect and support biodiversity.
    
- **Yellow/Red Roofs:** Platforms for renewable energy (solar) and social spaces (cafes, sports, and gardens) to improve livability.
    

### 3. Urban Connectivity & Scale

By bridging the **Coolsingel**—one of Rotterdam’s most heavily trafficked avenues—at a height of **30 meters**, the installation challenged traditional boundaries of public and private property.

- **Connectivity:** It physically linked iconic structures like the Bijenkorf department store and the World Trade Centre, showing that architecture can be a network rather than a series of isolated "islands."
    
- **Perspective:** It gave citizens a "bird's-eye" perspective of their environment, making the scale of unused space visible and tangible to the public.


We can use something similar for our elevated walkway. We could give it potential to connect straight to the train station instead of just being a separate structure
