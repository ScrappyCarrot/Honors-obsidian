Location: New York

It was initially an elevated freight track constructed in the 1930s. It was meant to carry goods through the meatpacking district in Manhattan. By the 1980s the rail was abandoned. 
"Through a strategy of _agri–tecture_ —part agriculture, part architecture— the High Line surface is digitized into discrete units of paving and planting which are assembled along the 1.5 miles into a variety of gradients from 100% paving to 100% soft, richly vegetated biotopes."- Diller Scofido & Renfro Architects

The High Line’s design is a groundbreaking strategy that fuses nature with the built environment, creating an uninterrupted flow between hardscaping and softscaping. This is achieved through a concept the designers call _“agri-tecture”_—part architecture, part agriculture. The park’s surface is divided into discrete paving and planting units, assembled into various gradients, ranging from 100% concrete paving to 100% densely vegetated biotopes.

The paving system, composed of precast concrete planks with open joints, encourages the emergence of wild grasses and other plants that poke through the cracks, reminiscent of the self-seeding growth that once overtook the abandoned rail line. The paving units are designed with tapered ends that seem to blend seamlessly into planting beds, creating a “pathless” landscape. This design encourages visitors to meander through the park in unscripted ways, fostering an organic interaction with the space.

The project was designed as a driver of economic and social revitalization for the area, as the meatpacking industry that sustained it was no longer there. It became a landmark, thus a mechanism of placemaking for the people living there. Even though this is a permanent solution, and our project is a more temporary one, we can use the same mechanisms to hint towards the eventual permanent state of the knoop XL with our structure. We can take the most important motifs of the redevelopment (such as the second ground of the station) and implement them in our own design. This might be hard as we would have to incorporate them in a fully modular/adaptable structure (might have to look into mathematical papers for shapes that-[[Research math papers (Black Maria)]])
