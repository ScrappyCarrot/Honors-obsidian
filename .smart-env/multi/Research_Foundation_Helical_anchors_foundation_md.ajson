main purpose of a helical anchor is to transfer structural loads to soil. Nowadays, helical anchors are used for a variety of applications in tension, compression and lateral loads. Typical tension applications of helical anchors include guy anchors for poles and towers, tiebacks for temporary or permanent retaining walls and foundation tiedowns. They can also be used for underpinning to lift sinking foundations, deep foundation elements to support walkways and boardwalks, and tilt-up wall braces. Also, helical anchors have become a foundation of choice for lateral load applications including slope stabilization, poles, towers and

Nowadays, helical anchors are used for a variety of applications in tension, compression and lateral loads. Typical tension applications of helical anchors include guy anchors for poles and towers, tiebacks for temporary or permanent retaining walls and foundation tiedowns. They can also be used for underpinning to lift sinking foundations, deep foundation elements to support walkways and boardwalks, and tilt-up wall braces.
