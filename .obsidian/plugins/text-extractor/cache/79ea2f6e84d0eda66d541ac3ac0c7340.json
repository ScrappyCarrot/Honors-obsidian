Metabolic was asked to t hink about this early in the development process from an integral sustainable and circular perspective. That is why Metabolic carried out an analysis of municipal policy and carried out a baseline measurement of the spatial characteristics and the dust flows through the area. From there, Metabolic identified opportunities and hotspots for the Knoop XL and drew up a devel opment vision. Sustainability and circularity means a broad view for us: urban ‘metabolism’, the metabolism through a region, we look at from the themes of climate resilience, water, biodiversity, materials, energy and mobility. IJ Source: Development vision Fellenoord, KCAP Architects&Planners, July 2018 The area brings Technology, Design and Knowledge together and offers a showcase for the Brainport by using new techniques in the field of solar energy, nature-inclusive design, plastic recycling and material innovation on facades and in public spaces. Materials from demolition and renovation of buildings and infrastructure are reused in new buildings, supply and demand connect in a construction hub that has been realized in collaboration. Roofs and facades instead of facades are designed and used for solar energy, greenery and rainwater collection. Orientation of new construction on the south for reducing energy demand. However, measures to reduce the heat island are taken into account. The subsurface is cleverly used for climate adaptation, sanitation and energy supply (Hot Cold Storage). It is connected to residual heat from the TU/e. Waste is collected separately from households and businesses. The Knoop XL works towards 0% residual waste through compost containers, recycling and smart logistics. The Dommel and the Fellenoord become green veins through the district, which promote climate resilience, biodiversity and a healthy city. By optimal connection to the (H)OV from the Central Station (capital letters) and good walkability, bicycles and pedestrians prevail: a car-free area ensures clean air and a livable character. The new Neckerspoel bus station contributes to this. Source: Development vision Fellenoord, KCAP Architects&Planners, July 2018 METABOLIC 5 CIRCULARY DEVELOPMENT EIKXL RECOMMENDATIONS DEVELOPMENT BUTTON XL No regrets circular area development • A construction hub (space demand approximately 5,000 m2)and cooperation between parties for connecting construction and demolition calendars. • Use of rainwater for, for example, flushing vacuum toilets, washing facilities or irrigation of gardens or public greenery • Set strict requirements for residential insulation, passive house standard and material use, also with a view to both energy and material savings and the heat island. • Use roofs and facades instead of façades for generating solar energy and integrating greenery on roofs; Possibly also urban agriculture on roofs. • Take advantage of the transformation of the area for the design of logistics regarding waste treatment and the placement of compost containers for food waste. Typical Button XL • Due to its central location, short walking distance and good cycling and (H)OV possibilities, the Knoop focuses on a car-free area, with possible further growth into a car-free area and the focus on cyclists and pedestrians. • Climate adaptation and nature-inclusive design as a key principle for the development of the area. • Infrastructure makes room for greenery for climate resistance (to at least 40% green), released material from demolition infrastructure (8,000 tons of asphalt, concrete) can be reused high-quality • Dommeldal greening, connecting, widening and connecting under the railway with the Gender to create a large green city strip. • Showcasing new technology for e.g. solar energy, plastic recycling and material innovation through linking with Technology, Design and Knowledge of the TU/e and Design Academy. • Connection to residual heat from Eindhoven University of Technology is a logical option for Heat Cold Storage (WKO). METABOLIC 6 CIRCULARY DEVELOPMENT EIKXL DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPES 1. Reduce consumption • Minimize (sustainable) energy demand through insulation, passive house standard . • Minimal use of materials during construction. • Avoid, reduce and reuse waste. 2. Focus on synergy • Link between Technology, Design and Knowledge (proximity TU/e, design academy). • Local exchange of residual flows (building materials, rainwater). • Synergy of supply and demand of (sustainable) energy at district and city level: exchange, storage and marketing of flexibility. • Flexible design of buildings and public space in terms of construction, materials and climate resistance (underground space). • Multimodal hub of mobility: (H)OV connections, cycling and walking routes and connections to the Brainport region ensure an emission-free, efficient switching machine. 3. Switch between building, area and the rest of the city • Closing at building level: • Material use: Insight into the urban mine. • Passive and modular construction, high- quality insulation. • Closing at area level: • Smart water storage and management. • Transport is shared and becomes emission- free. • Energy supply and renewable energy, heat supply (WKO, heat networks). • Waste management: waste separation and logistics. • Close at regional level: • Connecting green structures with main structure. • Value residual flows. • See how different areas can have synergy. With a view to exchanging, for example, building materials. o 4. Making climate resilience visible • Green as a pleasant experience and distinctive character. • Climate resistance as a business card (in parks, facades, roofs). • Greening and preventing hardening (reduction of infrastructure). • Integrating biodiversity into the area. • Multifunctional adaptive green and blue (e.g. city gardens). Points of attention: I Make trade-offs from a broad sustainable perspective: • Approach the developments transparently and create insight into the trade-offs between climate adaptation, green and sustainable energy: This requires a data-driven approach with a broad view. • The same applies to underground trade-offs between WKO and new sanitation. • Monitor progress towards a sustainable and circular Button XL: • Monitoring progress in areas such as material use, energy and climate adaptation from this research is crucial for ensuring sustainability and circularity. The demand for raw materials that cannot be met through synergy can be achieved through production and procurement by using clean, renewable, or otherwise enviro nmentally beneficial sources. In addition, it is important to get feedback on how the system works in order for it to function optimally. This includes the creation of transparent data and an information network (e.g. a material passport). Then we look at the scale at which different cycles can be closed.

The area wants to become an international metropolitan residential, working and residential area and the central hub of Brainport Eindhoven. An area with international allure and a hub of modalities. This transformation will take place in the next 20 years, and an area vision is currently being drawn up together with developers. There is a unique opportunity to provide insight into the opportunities and hotspots for integrating sustainability and circularity at the area level. Consultancy Metabolic has extensive experience with circular and sustainable area development, and has been approached to draw up a vision from this perspective in the development process around the International Knoop XL. The aim of the research is to draw up an area vision and a development framework for the International Node XL from an integral sustainable and circular perspective. o co -I c o w X o o o co -I c o Jib X o o o co -I c o an d X o o o co -I c x o o METABOLIC 10 CIRCULARY DEVELOPMENT EIKXL o cr> Sustainable and circular area development Circular area development is a relatively new field of work. Many innovations in the field of circular construction primarily focus on the building itself. Here, for example, we look at the impacts that material choices entail and energy-efficient construction. All these interventions are extremely useful, especially when the market is challenged to sustainable innovations. However, a large part of the impact for which the built environment is responsible is determined at area level. It is precisely at the area level that choices are made about infrastructure and mobility, and the place that various functions such as living, working and recreation are given in the urban environment. This not only affects the type of mobility, but also our energy supply and sanitation. Even if we look at ambitions in the field of climate resilience, there are important considerations to be made: Do we want to absorb peak showers with façade greenery and roof gardens? Or is there enough undeveloped space and urban greenery at area level? It is therefore a unique opportunity to take a first step towards circular area development for the International Knoop XL with a vision and development framework. TRAINING Several parties are preparing plans for developments that are expected to take place in the next twenty years at the International Knoop XL. To steer this transformation in the right direction, the municipality is working on a development vision and a development framework, in collaboration with, among others, a process office, urban planning office and mobility experts. Metabolic has been asked to think about this from an integral sustainable and circular perspective. Sustainability is an important pillar in the policy of the municipality of Eindhoven, and must therefore also be integrated into the area vision. Central themes in this sustainability policy are the energy transition, waste, green environment, sustainable mobility and climate adaptation. The earlier and clearer the vision on these topics can be given to developers, the better the developments can be aligned in this area. o co -I c o w X o o o co -I c o Jib X o o o co -I c o an d X o o o co -I c x o o Source: Development vision Fellenoord, KCAP Architects&Planners, July 2018 METABOLIC 11 CIRCULARY DEVELOPMENT EIKXL ADJUSTMENT &AMP; PROJECT PURPOSES Project objectives Four goals have been formulated for the project: • To gain insight into the functioning of the current system in the field of sustainability and circularity by carrying out a baseline measurement of the area. • Identify opportunities and hotspots for integrating circularity and sustainability into the transformation of the International Node XL. • Develop a development vision and development framework for the themes of climate resilience, water, biodiversity, materials, energy and mobility from an integral sustainable and circular perspective. • Attending the area sessions and design workshops around the larger development trajectory of the area to further explain the development vision. Outcomes We work towards these goals in four deliverables: • Analysis of municipal policies and objectives in the field of sustainability and circularity. • A baseline measurement of the area: Dust flow analysis of materials, energy and water and a spatial analysis. • The main opportunities and hotspots for integrating circularity and sustainability within the development of the area. • A sustainable and circular development vision and development framework for the transformation of the International Knoop XL.

This research fits within the first of the 3 development trajectories, as drawn up by APPM: 1. Achieving sustainable urban scale jump. 2. Strengthen breeding ground innovative top region. 3. Keeping the business climate attractive through optimal (international) connections. The results of this research were discussed and tested during the area sessions and design workshops, where the transformation is being designed together with the municipality, developers and landowners in the area. This research will serve as a basis for discussion during these meetings, so that a sustainable vision can be developed together with all stakeholders in the area. AREA VISSION &AMP; AREA SESSIONS Municipality, developers and landowners in conversation during one of the area sessions. CHAPTER 01 CHAPTER 03 CHAPTER 04 CHAPTER 05 CHAPTER 06 CHAPTER 02 The development of the International Knoop XL promotes the business climate of Brainport Eindhoven and should become an international metropolitan residential, working and residential area. The area is the central hub of Brainport Eindhoven, where the region is connected at all scales by (H)OV and bicycle. The station environment is also the place for the new knowledge and service economy. A metropolitan area with space for living, working and relaxation. The International Knoop XL fits in with the growth of the center of Eindhoven and aspires to a high density and a high degree of functional mixing. Meeting, exchange, innovation and experimentation are central. As a central point in the innovation ecosystem of campuses and distributed innovative companies, the heart of Brainport Eindhoven is created, which is still missing. These plans can be summarized in four main ambitions: • Interaction Environments for the New Economy. • Node of sustainable mobility. • The highest living environment. • Landscape as location factor.

She also continues to sharpen her ambitions for urban development. The current policy and plans on circularity, climate and sustainability have been analysed, so that the sustainability vision for the International Knoop XL fits in with this. In this way it can also be determined what the contribution of the International Knoop XL can be to achieve the set goals and ambitions.

We do this for a business as usual (BAU) scenario in which the current plans are implemented. This gives us insight into what opportunities and hotspots there are for integrating sustainability and circularity and where there is room for interventions. We did this by performing two analyses: • Material flow analysis: by analysing the ‘metabolism’ of materials, water and energy through the area, it becomes clear how the system now functions and where the greatest impact can be achieved: For example, is there a lot of potential for sustainable energy generation, or can building materials be cleverly reused? • Spatial analysis: spatial analysis of the area on climate resilience, water, biodiversity, health, materials (the urban mine) and mobility provides insight into the frameworks within which sustainability and circularity can be implemented.

The municipality is the largest owner and the area has a low building intensity. This offers great potential for sustainable redevelopment. The spatial vision of the KCAP proposes the following tranformations: • Fellenoord becomes a city boulevard. • There will be plenty of room for the Dommel Valley. • The Button becomes a multimodal node. In addition, there is a first proposal for the new building made by KCAP, visually displayed on the previous page. The gross floor area (GVO) of the new building is as follows: Total plinths Total towers 531.150 295.300 m2 BVO m2 BVO Total BVO 826.450 m2 BVO Figure 2: Indication land use development vision. Source: KCAP An important distinction can be made between the building level (construction, precise subdivision) and the framework (which functions come true in the public space) in the area. This pr oject focuses on a baseline measurement and identifying opportunities and hotspots for both levels: where are the possibilities for making the International Knoop XL future-proof in the field of circularity and sustainability?

STOFSTROOMANALYSE HITTESTRE SS Taking heat stress into account is an important part of a climate-resilient area. In view of the developments of the built environment within Knoop XL, we must also take into account the development of a heat island. A Hotspot: The urban heat island can pose health hazards and needs to be addressed in urban and petrified areas within EIKXL. O Opportunity: In the current plans, both the Fellenoord and the green area around the Dommel will become more intensively green. Reduction of hardening and urban greenery contribute to reducing heat stress. Under the crown of a tree, the temperature can be as much as 15 degrees Celsius lower than a few meters away and the cooling effect of a park can be measured even 2 kilometers away. O Opportunity: The implementation of green roofs has a beneficial effect: with a 6% increase in the number of green roofs in a city, summer peak temperatures will drop by 1.5 degrees Celsius (Bade et al., 2011). O Opportunity: At building level, solar shading, material use, ventilation and building orientation can be taken into account (TNO, 2014). Figure 4: The temperature in the inner city can be up to 4 to 5 degrees Celsius higher than in landscape areas (Source: EPA, 2008).

AUTOMATIC AVAILABILITY Traffic is the main cause of air pollution, especially in the inner city and around (ring) roads. PM10 (55%) and NOx (20%) have the greatest effect on the environmental-related burden of disease in the Netherlands (RIVM, 2016). The transition to electric driving will contribute to solving NOx bottlenecks in the coming years. □ Outline EIKXL Water o Charging stations Parking spaces (zones): ■ 0 - 200 ■ 200 - 400 ■ 401 - 600 ■ 600+ 4B.

STOFSTROOMANALYSE What is a dust flow analysis? A dust flow analysis, also known as Material Flow Analysis (MFA), is a systematic assessment of dust flows and stocks of (raw) substances within a system, with a defined scope in terms of space and time. For the KnoopXL, we have modelled the flows of materials, energy and water through the area per year in a ‘business as usual’ scenario, based on current plans up to 2043. The result of this analysis is visualized in a so-called Sankey diagram. The Sankey diagram shows from which sources a ‘flow’ comes (on the left side), how it is used or transformed within the area (center) and how the ‘flow’ eventually leaves the system and is processed (on the right side of the diagram). What can you do with a dust flow analysis? Physical flows are the basis of many environmental impacts that determine the degree of sustainability and resilience of a system. Think of the energy we use to heat a building or the materials needed to build houses and the building waste that is released during the demolition. This is how we gain insight into: • What is the dynamics of the system: How do materials, energy and water flow through the area and how do they relate to each other? • Where are the biggest hotspots in terms of impact (in terms of material use, energy consumption or emissions) in the system? • Where are opportunities for sustainability and synergy in the system: Can we reuse outgoing currents or can we use roofs for energy generation? 38 4A. SPECIAL ANALYSIS 4B. STOFSTROOMANALYSE APPOINTMENTS &AM; CALCULATION The current programming and characteristics of the area are the starting points in the analysis, a business as usual scenario. It implements the current plans without additional measures and interventions in the area of the energy and raw materials transition, or changes to existing plans for demolition, renovation and new construction. This allows the opportunities and hotspots to be determined in order to reduce the ‘footprint’ of the area. The calculations come from our models and are based on figures from the scientific literature and results and data from previous projects of Metabolic. By combining these figures with the construction and demolition task of the area, a prediction has been made of the material flows. This also takes into account the increase in inhabitants and the associated consumption patterns. METABOLIC Assumptions in the calculation: • Based on the programming of KCAP, we determine how much is being built and demolished. • Time horizon: 25 years (until2043). • Dust streams shall be normalised to use over 1 year. • Construction and demolition infrastructure not included. 39 Calculation: • Required and released building materials over the entire time horizon. • Energy and water consumption through construction and demolition. • Energy and water consumption during use of the final buildings. • The emissions caused by mobility, but also the construction and use of the buildings. • Theoretical potential thermal and solar energy when installing solar panels. • Theoretical potential for rainwater collection when taken into account during construction.

SPECIAL ANALYSIS 4B. STOFSTROOMANALYSE VIEWS FROM STOFSTROOMANALYSE ^1 Inputs Outputs Water 4 Water • There is a high input of water in the area, mainly due to the use of residents. In view of a changing climate and changing weather conditions, we must also consider increasing drought. • There is also a high output of water in the area, exploring options to recover nutrients from water should be explored. • The roofs in the area are able to meet 9% of the water demand. t Building materials CO2emission s • The new construction task requires 52,000 tonnes of building material per year: Concrete, in particular, is an important hotspot with 67% of total demand and high embedded energy and CO2impact. • During the construction and use phase, there is an emission of 40,000 tonnes of CO2- equivalent per year, for 95% from the use phase. F Energy Waste • The building task provides an energy task of 10 TJ per year, mainly by transporting building materials: A construction hub could provide a solution. • For the total energy demand, gas is still taken into account in the business-as-usual scenario, but this will increasingly shift to sustainable alternatives: this should be taken into account in the electricity grid. • A third of the waste is already recycled, but there is also a lot of incineration (26%). Here lies an opportunity to integrate better waste separation in the newly built area by, for example, placing compost containers underground.

For example, use for flushing vacuum toilets, washing facilities or irrigation of gardens or public greenery. 27% onne-energy By installing solar panels on the available roof surface, 27% of the energy demand can be met: enough for the electricity demand of 4,400 households METABOLIC 42 CIRCULARY DEVELOPMENT EIKXL CHAPTER 01 CHAPTER 02 CHAPTER 03 CHAPTER 04 CHAPTER 05 CHAPTER 06 4A. SPECIAL ANALYSIS 4B. STOFSTROOMANALYSE COMPLETE CONCLUSIONS METABOLIC • The International Knoop XL is still characterized by office buildings and infrastructure, but offers great potential to become a sustainable and future-proof area. • Due to its central location and good accessibility with (H)OV, bicycle and walking, there are opportunities to make it a car-free or even car-free area. • The large building task brings with it a high demand for building materials (concrete) and energy, here are opportunities for circularity. • The transformation also offers opportunities for redesigning the energy system. For example, the roofs potentially provide 20-35% of the required demand for PV, and there are opportunities for CHP and heat networks. • Biodiversity and climate resilience must be promoted, the space created by reducing the infrastructure and the Dommel offer opportunities for greening and connection to the main ecological structure. 43 CIRCULARY DEVELOPMENT EIKXL CHAPTER 01 CHAPTER 02 CHAPTER 03 CHAPTER 04 CHAPTER 05 CHAPTER 06 CHAPTER 01 CHAPTER 02 CHAPTER 03 CHAPTER 04 CHAPTER 05 CHAPTER 06 OPPORTUNITIES AND HOTSPOTS From the baseline measurement of the area, we have identified opportunities and hotspots based on the spatial characteristics and dust flows that flow through the area. We have summarized these into a top 5 of opportunities and hotspots for both the building level and the framework of the area. These opportunities and hotspots are eventually combined with the baseline measurement and municipal policy to arrive at a development vision and development framework for the International Knoop XL. CHAPTER 01 CHAPTER 02 CHAPTER 03 CHAPTER 04 CHAPTER 05 CHAPTER 06 METABOLIC Source: Development vision Fellenoord, KCAP Architects&Planners, July 2018 CIRCULARY DEVELOPMENT EIKXL 45 HOTSPOTS & OPPORTUNITIES: CONSTRUCTION LEVEL High demand for building materials (52,000 tons) per year as a result of the more than 800,000 m2 BVO building assignment: 67% of that is concrete. Construction task creates large energy demand (10 TJ per year) by transporting materials. The water consumption of the built environment is high (over 700,000 m 3 or 290 Olympic swimming pools per year) Building natural gas-free requires new forms of heating, the region has few local sustainable heat sources and this can be a major burden on the grid. Generating solar energy (potentially 27% of energy demand) and integrating greenery is a challenge when building in height. 46 Both in construction (passive construction, remountable construction, splitting houses, recycled concrete) and demolition (circular demolition) there are opportunities for circularity. Mapping the urban mine at area level in cooperation (e.g. with the Green Business Club) creates a basis for reuse. A construction hub (space demand about 5,000 m2)and cooperation between the parties can bring great savings and synergy (up to 66% less fuel). Use roofs for rainwater collection (9% of total water demand), and make sure that water storage is arranged at building level. Strict requirements for insulation of homes and the smart integration of Heat Cold Storage (WKO) and use of substrate. Generating solar energy and integrating greenery on roofs (potentially 27% generation) and facades; Possibly urban agriculture on roofs. CIRCULARY DEVELOPMENT EIKXL CHAPTER 01 CHAPTER 02 CHAPTER 03 CHAPTER 04 CHAPTER 05 CHAPTER 06 @ HOTSPOTS &AMP; OPPORTUNITIES: RAAMWERK Car use causes poor air quality (PM10 and NOx responsible for 75% environmental-related disease burden) and a lot of space use (Fellenoord sometimes up to 100 meters wide, parking spaces take up 54,000 m 2 within the area). Despite the fact that a lot of waste is already recycled, a significant proportion (44%) of the waste is still incinerated. The area is characterized by a lot of infrastructure and hardening (33% of the area is green), which poses a risk to climate resilience. Waterlogging in the southwest and around the Fellenoord at 60 mm / hour waterfall. The use of the subsurface becomes a challenge with new sanitation and heating of the area (WKO). Central location, short walking distance and good bike and (H)OV accessibility offers unique opportunity for car-free area and focus on the bike and pedestrians. Transformation of the area offers opportunities for waste separation at the source and placement of compost containers for food waste. Infrastructure can be converted to green for climate resistance (to at least 40% green), material released from demolition infrastructure (8,000 tons of asphalt, concrete) can be reused in high quality. Greening, connecting and widening Dommeldal, and connecting under the track with the Gender to create a large green city strip. Arranging water storage at building level to prevent transport and smart use of subsurface for WKO. The proposal for a park on top of Neckerspoel bus station offers possibilities for water retention. METABOLIC 47 CIRCULARY DEVELOPMENT EIKXL CHAPTER 01 CHAPTER 02 CHAPTER 03 CHAPTER 04 CHAPTER 05 CHAPTER 06 We are working towards a development vision and development framework, where the question is: How do we make the area future-proof, sustainable and circular? There is a unique opportunity to turn the International Knoop XL into a sustainability champion. We must set the bar high for this, and maintain flexibility to even raise ambitions in the future. Due to the large transformation and central location of the area, there are opportunities to use area development to lead by example in terms of circularity, climate resilience, energy and mobility. The identified opportunities and hotspots come together here to form a vision for the International Knoop XL. The vision is then translated into development principles that can be taken into account in the process of area development, and can provide guidance during the next steps in realization. The vision for the International Knoop XL is also in line with the sustainable objectives of the Municipality of Eindhoven. This transformation offers a unique opportunity to make big steps in the sustainable ambitions of the municipality. We have highlighted some objectives to which the vision contributes. TOWARDS A DEVELOPMENT VISSION METABOLIC 49 CIRCULARY DEVELOPMENT EIKXL CHAPTER 01 CHAPTER 02 CHAPTER 03 CHAPTER 04 CHAPTER 05 The area brings Technology, Design and Knowledge together and offers a showcase for the Brainport by using new techniques in the field of solar energy, nature-inclusive design, plastic recycling and material innovation on facades and in public spaces. Materials from demolition and renovation of buildings and infrastructure are reused in new buildings, supply and demand connect in a construction hub that has been realized in collaboration. Roofs and facades instead of facades are designed and used for solar energy, greenery and rainwater collection. Orientation of new construction on the south for reducing energy demand. However, measures to reduce the heat island are taken into account. The subsurface is cleverly used for climate adaptation, sanitation and energy supply (Hot Cold Storage). It is connected to residual heat from the TU/e. Waste is collected separately from households and businesses. The Knoop XL works towards 0% residual waste through compost containers, recycling and smart logistics. The Dommel and the Fellenoord become green veins through the district, which promote climate resilience, biodiversity and a healthy city. By optimal connection to the (H)OV from the Central Station (capital letters) and good walkability, bicycles and pedestrians prevail: a car-free area ensures clean air and a livable character. The new Neckerspoel bus station contributes to this. Vision The Knoop XL uses its transformation to reduce the consumption of raw materials and takes an exemplary role on the way to the national vision to be 100% circular by 2050. In a construction hub, the materials from the demolition of buildings and the large number of roads around the Fellenoord are temporarily stored and reused in new buildings. The ambition of 15% old concrete processing can be raised. By understanding the urban mine, supply and demand can be smartly matched. The planned construction in the Knoop XL takes lifespan, flexibility, impact of materials and design for disassembly into account in the design and the municipality rewards circularity in the land issue. In addition, there is room in the area for making circularity visible byTechniek, Design and Kennis: public space in parks and around the Dommel demonstrate technology and logistics regarding e.g. composting and plastic recycling. Local businesses are encouraged to use each other's residual flows to make the residents of the Knoop XL aware of the raw materials they use. 51 o DEVELOPMENT VISSION: MATERIALS CIRCULARY DEVELOPMENT EIKXL Ambition of the municipality • 50% less use of primary raw materials by 2030. • 0% residual household waste in 2020. • At least 15% old concrete processed in rivets, tiles, curbs. • Integrating circularity into area development and land sales. LEGENDA: • Ambition not achievable within Knoop XL • Ambition challenging within Knoop XL • Ambition achievable within Knoop XLCHAPTER 01 CHAPTER 02 CHAPTER 03 CHAPTER 04 CHAPTER 05 METABOLIC 61 CIRCULARY DEVELOPMENT EIKXL Vision There are great opportunities within the area to take climate resilience as a starting point in the design of the area. The Knoop XL makes the often invisible themes of climate resilience and biodiversity visible in the streets. Here there are great possibilities for the confluence of the ‘left and right hemispheres of the brain’, technology and design. The Button XL combines compaction with greening: asphalt and concrete turn into green strips, roofs and facades to reduce flooding and heat stress. Water storage is natural where possible, regulated at building level with buffer zones. A healthy Dommel gets a prominent place where local plant species are made visible to visitors. A strong connection with the main ecological structure ensures a high biodiversity. The new Dommel Passage makes this connection attractive to wanders. Water purification takes place visibly, for example in a Biopolus around the Dommel. Urban agriculture, perhaps on city roofs, and edible plants and trees promote social cohesion and play an educational factor. Ambition of the municipality • 100% climate-resilient buildings and public space. • Reducing hardening to minimize waterlogging and heat stress. • Develop ecological greenery to increase biodiversity, intensify connections.

It has everything for this: a central location, excellent (H)OV connections and connection with technology and knowledge of the TU/e and Design Academy. Proximity and fast connections lead to deployment on bicycle, (electric) public transport, shared mobility and new services as an alternative to car ownership and use (from car-poor, to car-free to car-free). It is then sent to a car-free area. Its transformation has been carried out according to the passive house standard, making the area energy efficient and bringing the benefits to the residents. The Knoop XL smartly connects to TU/e heat sources, and uses solar panels on roofs and facades, in combination with greenery. A smart grid reduces peak loads on the grid. Parking hubs outside the area and shared bikes and scooters provide space gains and a pleasant living environment. Ambition of the municipality • Built environment natural gas free by 2050. • Eindhoven energy neutral in 2045. • Zero-emission vehicles only in 2050. • A city, with where it can walk more, cycle and use public transport. A car-free area, and eventually a car-free area.

Orientation buildings on south, southeast and southwest for lower net energy use of passive buildings. o Deterring cars within the area reduces emissions. o Connecting green structures in the area, in addition to nature-inclusive building on the plots connection between the plots through connecting routes in the area. o Asphalt and concrete released (10,000 tonnes) for demolition infrastructure directly reused in construction assignment. o Circular procurement in new construction and demolition. o Transport modes are interlinked, focus on bicycle and pedestrians and sub- concepts. o Water-efficient installations and equipment (cranes / showers) can be included in renovations and new construction. Existing buildings must be renovated for energy savings and made suitable for natural gas-free heating. o High-quality insulation and passive house standard reduce energy demand. o Use of rainwater for, for example, flushing vacuum toilets, washing facilities or irrigation of gardens or public greenery. Exchanging residual heat (WKO) is difficult due to a ‘full’ surface. o More concrete elaboration of smart grid for peak reduction. Building hub for materials requires space during the transformation (5,000 m2)and also reduces energy consumption. Figure 6: Opportunities and challenges for reducing consumption and focusing on synergy. METABOLIC 54 CIRCULARY DEVELOPMENT EIKXL DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPES Developing an area is not something you do alone. To anchor the sustainable vision in the larger development of the Knoop XL, we have drawn up four development principles that can give direction to the process. © REDUCING USE • Minimize (sustainable) energy demand. • Minimal use of materials during construction. • Avoid, reduce and reuse waste. @ INFORMATION ON SYNERGY • Link between Technology, Design and Knowledge (proximity TU/e, design academy). • Local exchange of residual flows (building materials, rainwater). • Synergy of supply and demand of (sustainable) energy at district and city level: exchange, storage and marketing of flexibility. • Flexible design of buildings and public space in terms of construction, material and climate resistance (underground space). • Multimodal hub of mobility: (H)OV connections, cycling and walking routes and connections to the Brainport region ensure an emission-free, efficient switching machine. o Opportunities A Challenges CHAPTER 01 CHAPTER 02 CHAPTER 03 CHAPTER 04 CHAPTER 05 DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPES o Opportunities A Challenges The demand for raw materials that cannot be met through synergy can be achieved through production and procurement by using c lean, renewable, or otherwise environmentally beneficial sources. In addition, it is important to get feedback on how the system works in order for it to function optimally. This includes the creation of transparent data and an information network (e.g. a material passport). Then we look at the scale at which different cycles can be closed. (Jh CHANGES BETWEEN BUILDING, AREA AND REST OF THE CITY Closing at building level: • Material use: Insight into the urban mine. • Passive and modular construction, high-quality insulation. Closing at area level: • Smart water storage and management. • Transport is shared and becomes emission-free. • Energy supply and renewable energy, heat supply (WKO, heat networks). • Waste management: waste separation and logistics. Close at regional level: • Connecting green structures with main structure. • Value residual flows. • See how different areas can have synergy. With a view to exchanging, for example, building materials. o Building materials with low environmental impact (MKI score). Orientation buildings on the south. o Water storage at building level, buffer zones at area level. o Emission-free logistics for waste collection. o Partial mobility at (H)OV and in the neighbourhood: bicycles, (electric) scooters. o Exchange of (organic) residual flows with industry, agriculture. Urba n mining. o Collecting car transport at parking hubs, switch to (H)OV and bicycle. METABOLIC o Material passports. o Take circularity into account land issue policy. o Smart grid for smart linking demand and supply, balancing net. o Vermicompost containers for composting GFT waste. Rooftops need a trade-off between solar power generation and greenery. o Promoting biodiversity through connection to the main ecological structure. Consideration of generating renewable energy from surrounding areas vs. self- generating.

To further facilitate the process of area development of the International Knoop XL, we see a number of possible next steps: Calculating proposed interventions and translating them into spatial preconditions. This can also be done in different scenarios, e.g. for heat and mobility (automatic, fully electric). This also takes into account which functions and interventions where can countries in the area. The calculation of business cases within the area, in order to gain more clarity about the economic and ecological conditions of various interventions. Collaboration and co-creation through stakeholder sessions is of great importance. Gap analysis of existing plans: which part of the ambitions is possible given the spatial characteristics (for municipality and landowners). Inspiration session with Eindhoven University of Technology and the Design Academy for the development of the area. Interesting for further exploring and accelerating the circular economy within Eindhoven: • Mapping the stocks of materials in the built environment (urban mine). • Drawing up business cases for the high- quality use of residual flows in the Eindhoven area • Setting up a monitoring framework for the transition to a circular economy in the municipality of Eindhoven as a whole.
