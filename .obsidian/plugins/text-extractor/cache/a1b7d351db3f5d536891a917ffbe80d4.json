secretariat of which is held by BSI. This European Standard shall be given the status of a national standard, either by publication of an identical text or by endorsement, at the latest by October 2002, and conflicting national standards shall be withdrawn at the latest by March 2010. CEN/TC 250 is responsible for all Structural Eurocodes. This document supersedes ENV 1991-2-1: 1995. The annexes A and B are informative. According to the CEN/CENELEC Internal Regulations, the national standards organizations of the following countries are bound to implement this European Standard: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Gern1any, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Background of the Eurocode progranlme In 1975, the Commission of the European Community decided on an action programme in the field of construction, based on article 95 of the Treaty. The objective of the programlne was the elimination of technical obstacles to trade and the harmonisation of technical specifications. Within this action programn1e, the Commission took the initiative to establish a set of harn10nised technicallules for the design of construction works which, in a first stage, would serve as an alternative to the national rules in force in the Member States and, ultimately, would replace them. For fifteen years, the Commission, with the help of a Steering Committee with Representatives of Member States, conducted the development of the Eurocodes programme, which led to the first generation of European codes in the 1980s. In 1989, the Commission and the Melnber States of the EU and EFTA decided, on the basis of an agreemene between the Commission and CEN, to transfer the preparation and the publication of the Eurocodes to CEN through a series of Mandates, in order to provide them with a future status of European Standard (EN). This links de Jacto the Eurocodes with the provisions of all the Council's Directives and/or Con1mission's Decisions dealing with European standards (e.g. the Council Directive 891106IEEC on I Agreement between the Commission of the European Communities and the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) concerning the work on EUROCODES for the design of building and civil engineering works (BCICEN/03/89). 4 BS EN 1991-1-1:2002 EN 1991-1-1:2002 (E) construction products - CPD and Council Directives 93/37/EEC, 92/50/EEC and 89/440lEEC on public works and services and equivalent EFT A Directives initiated in pursuit of setting up the internal nlarket). The Structural Eurocode progranune con1prises the following standards generally consisting of a number of Parts: EN 1990 EN 1991 EN 1992 EN 1993 EN 1994 EN 1995 EN 1996 EN 1997 EN 1998 EN 1999 Eurocode: Eurocode 1: Eurocode 2: Eurocode 3: Eurocode 4: Eurocode 5: Eurocode 6: Eurocode 7: Eurocode 8: Eurocode 9: Basis of Structural Design Actions on structures Design of concrete structures Design of steel structures Design of composite steel and concrete structures Design of timber structures Design of masonry structures Geotechnical design Design of structures for earthquake resistance Design of aluminium structures Eurocode standards recognise the responsibility of regulatory authorities in each Member State and have safeguarded their right to determine values related to regulatory safety n1atters at national level where these continue to vary from State to State. Status and field of application of Eurocodes The Member States of the EU and EFT A recognise that Eurocodes serve as reference docUlnents for the following purposes: as a Ineans to prove compliance of building and civil engineering works with the essential requirements of Council Directive 89/1 061EEC, particularly Essential Requirement N° 1 - Mechanical resistance and stability and Essential Requiren1ent N°2 - Safety in case of fire ; as a basis for specifying contracts for construction works and related engineering services; as a fratnework for drawing up harmonised technical specifications for constluction products (ENs and ETAs) The Eurocodes, as far as they concern the construction works themselves, have a direct relationship with the Interpretative Documents 2 referred to in Article 12 of the CPD, although they are of a different nature fron1 harn10nised product standards'. Therefore, technical aspects arising from the Eurocodes work need to be adequately considered by ') - According to Art. 3.3 of the CPD, the essential requirements (ERs) shall be given concrete form in interpretative documents for the creation of the necessary links between the essential requirements and the mandates for harmonised ENs and ET AGs/ET As. According to Art. 12 of the CPD the interpretative documents shall : a) give concrete form to the essential requirements by harmonising the terminology and the technical bases and indicating classes or levels for each requirement where necessary; b) indicate methods of correlating these classes or levels of requirement with the technical specifications, e.g. methods of calculation and of proof, technical rules for project design, etc. ; c) serve as a reference for the establishment of harmonised standards and guidelines for European technical approvals. The Eurocodes, de facto, playa similar role in the field of the ER 1 and a part of ER 2. 5 BS EN 1991-1-1:2002 EN 1991-1-1:2002 (E) CEN Technical Corrunittees and/or EOT A Working Groups working on product standards with a view to achieving full compatibility of these technical specifications with the Eurocodes. The Eurocode standards provide common structural design rules for everyday use for the design of whole structures and component products of both a traditional and an innovative nature. Unusual forms of construction or design conditions are not specifically covered and additional expert consideration will be required by the designer in such cases. National Standards implementing Eurocodes The National Standards implen1enting Eurocodes will comprise the full text of the Eurocode (including any annexes), as published by CEN, which may be preceded by a National title page and National foreword, and may be followed by a National annex. The National annex Inay only contain information on those parameters which are left open in the Eurocode for national choice, known as Nationally Determined Parameters, to be used for the design of buildings and civil engineering works to be constructed in the country concerned, i.e. : - values and/or classes where alternatives are given in the Eurocode, - values to be used where a symbol only is given in the Eurocode, country specific data (geographical, climatic, etc.), e.g. snow nlap, the procedure to be used where alternative procedures are given in the Eurocode;-. It may also contain decisions on the application of informative annexes, references to non-contradictory complenlentary information to assist the user to apply the Eurocode. Links between Eurocodes and harmonised technical specifications (ENs and ETAs) for products There is a need for consistency between the harmonised technical specifications for construction products and the technical rules for works 4 • Furthermore, aU the information accompanying the CE Marking of the construction products which refer to Eurocodes should clearly Inention which Nationally Determined Parameters have been taken into account. Additional information specific for EN 1991-1-1 EN 1991-1-1 gives design guidance and actions for the structural design of buildings and civil engineering works, including the following aspects: - densities of construction materials and stored materials; self-weight of construction elements, and imposed loads for buildings. 4 see Art.3.3 and Art. 12 of the CPO, as well as clauses 4.2, 4.3.1,4.3.2 and 5.2 of ID I. 6 BS EN 1991·1·1:2002 EN 1991-1-1:2002 (E) EN 1991-1-1 is intended for clients, designers, contractors and public authorities. EN 1991-1-1 is intended to be used with EN 1990, the other Parts of EN 1991 and EN 1992 to EN 1999 for the design of structures. National annex for EN 1991-1-1 This standard gives alternative procedures, values and recommendations for classes with notes indicating where National choices have to be made, therefore the National Standard in1plementing EN 1991 1-1 should have a National Annex containing all Nationally Determined Parameters to be used for the design of buildings and civil engineering works to be constructed in the relevant country. National choice is allowed in EN 1991-1-1 through: - 2.2(3), 5.2.3(1) to 5.2.3(5), 6.3.1.1(1)P (Table 6.1), 6.3.1.2(1)P (Table 6.2), - 6.3.1.2(10) & (11), - 6.3.2.2 (1)P (Table 6.4), 6.3.3.2(1) (Table 6.8), - 6.3.4.2(1) (Table 6.l0) - 6.4 (1) (Table 6.12) 7 BS EN 1991-1-1:2002 EN 1991-1-1:2002 (E) Section 1 General 1.1 Scope (l) EN 1991-] I gives design guidance and actions for the structural design of buildings and civil engineering works including S01l1e geotechnical aspects for the following subjects: Densities of construction materials and stored materials; Self-weight of construction works; Imposed loads for buildings. (2) Section 4 and Annex A give nominal values for densities of specific building materials, additional materials for bridges and stored materials. In addition for specific materials the of repose is provided. (3) Section 5 provides methods for the assessment of the characteristic values of self- weight of construction works. (4) Section 6 gives characteristic values of imposed loads for floors and roofs according to category of use in the following areas in buildings: residential, social, commercial and administration areas; CT'A1\",::! CTP and vehicle traffic areas; areas for storage and industrial activities; roofs; helicopter landing areas. (5) The loads on traffic areas in Section 6 refer to vehicles up to a gross vehicle weight of 160 kN. The design for traffic areas for heavy vehicles of more than 160 kN gross weight needs to be agreed with the relevant authority. Further inforn1ation may be obtained from EN 1991-2. (6) For barriers or walls having the function of barriers, horizontal forces are given in Section 6. Annex B gives additional guidance for vehicle barriers in car parks. NOTE Forces due to vehicle impact are specified in EN 1991-1-7 and EN 1991-2. (7) For the design situations and effects of actions in silos and tanks caused by water or other material s see EN 1991-3. 8 BS EN 1991-1-1:2002 EN 1991-1-1:2002 (E) 1.2 Normative References This European Standard incorporates by dated or undated reference provisions from other publications. These normative references are cited at the appropriate places in the text and the publications are listed hereafter. For dated references, subsequent amendn1ents to, or revisions of, any of these publications apply to this European Standard only when incorporated in it by amendment or revision. For undated references the latest edition of the publication referred to applies (including amendments). NOTE 1 The Eurocodes were published as European Prestandards.

(2) The Principles comprise: general statements and definitions for which there is no alternative, as well as requirements and analytical models for which no alternative is permitted unless specifically stated. (3) The Principles are identified by the letter P following the paragraph number. (4) The Application Rules are generally recognised rules which comply with the Principles and satisfy their requirements. (5) It is permissible to use alternative design rules different from the Application Rules gi ven in EN 1991-1-1 for works, provided that it is shown that the alternative rules accord with the relevant Principles and are at least equivalent with regard to the structural safety, serviceability and durability which would be expected when using the Eurocodes. NOTE If an alternative design rule is substituted for an Application Rule, the resulting design cannot be claimed to be wholly in accordance with EN 1991-1-1 although the design will remain in accordance with 9 BS EN 1991-1-1:2002 EN 1991-1-1:2002 (E) the Principles of EN 1991-] - J. When EN 1991-1-1 is used in respect of a property listed in an Annex Z of a product standard or an ETAG, the use of an alternative design rule may not be acceptable for CE marking. (6) In this Part the Application Rules are identified by a number in brackets, e.g. as this clause. 1.4 Terms and definitions For the purposes of this European Standard, the terms and definitions given in ISO 2394, ISO 3898, ISO 8930 and the following apply. Additionally for the purposes of this standard a basic list of terms and definitions is provided in EN 1990, 1.5. 1.4.1 bulk weight density the bulk weight density is the overall weight per unit volun1e of a material, including a normal distribution of n1icro-voids, voids and pores NOTE: In everyday usage this term is frequently abbreviated to \"densi ty\" (which is strictly mass per unit volume). 1.4.2 angle of repose the angle of repose is the angle which the natural slope of the sides of a heaped pile of loose material makes to the horizontal 1.4.3 gross weight of vehicle the gross weight of a vehicle includes the self-weight of the vehicle together with the Dlaximum weight of the goods it is permitted to carry 1.4.4 structural elenlents stluctural elements comprise the primary structural frame and supporting structures. For bridges, structural elements comprise girders, structural slabs and elements providing support such as cable stays 1.4.5 non structural elements non structural elements are those that include completion and finishing elements connected with the structure, including road surfacing and non-structural parapets. They also include services and machinery fixed permanently to, or within, the structure 10 1.4.6 partitions non load bearing walls 1.4.7 movable partitions BS EN 1991-1-1:2002 EN 1991-1-1:2002 (E) movable partitions are those which can be moved on the flOOf, be added or renl0ved or re-built at another place 1.5 Symbols (I) For the purposes of this European standard, the following symbols apply. NOTE The notation used is based on ISO 3898: 1997. (2) A basic list of sYlnbols is provided in EN 1990 clause 1.6 and the additional notations below are specific to this part of EN 1991. Latin upper case letters A loaded area Ao basic area Qk characteristic value of a variable concentrated load Latin lower case letters gk weight per unit area, or weight per unit length 11 nun1ber of storeys qk characteristic value of a uniformly distributed load, or line load Lower case Greek letters aA reduction factor an reduction factor r bulk weight density tp dynamic magnification factor If/o factor for combination value of a variable action, see table A.I.I of EN 1990 ¢ angle of repose (degrees) 11 BS EN 1991-1-1:2002 EN 1991-1-1:2002 (E) 2.1 Self-weight Section 2 Classification of actions (1) The self-weight of construction works should be classified as a pernlanent fixed action, see EN 1990, 1.S.3 and 4.1.1. (2) Where this self-weight can vary in time, it should be taken into account by the upper and lower characteristic values (see EN 1990,4.1.2). However, in some cases where it is free (e.g. for lnovable partitions, see 6.3.1.2(8)), it should be treated as an additional inlposed load. NOTE This applies in particular when the \"permanent\" actions may be favourable. (3)P The loads due to ballast shall be considered as permanent actions and possible redistributions of ballast shall be taken into account in the design, see S.2.2 (1) and (2). (4)P The earth loads on roofs and terraces shall be considered as permanent actions. (S) With regard to 2.1(3)P and 2.1(4)P, the design should consider variations in 1110isture content and variation in depth, that Inay be caused by uncontrolled accumulation during the design life of the structure. NOTE For detailed information on earth pressures see EN 1997. 2.2 Imposed loads (l)P Imposed loads shall be classified as variable free actions, unless otherwise specified in this standard, see EN 1990, 1.S.3 and 4.1.1. NOTE For imposed loads on bridges see EN 1991-2. (2) When considering the accidental design situation where impact from vehicles or accidental loads from machines may be relevant, these loads should be taken from EN 1991-1-7. (3) Imposed loads should be taken into account as quasi-static actions (see EN 1990, 1.S.3.13). The load nlodels may include dynamic effects if there is no risk of resonance or other significant dynamic response of the structure, see EN 1992 to EN 1999. If resonance effects from syncronised rythmical movement of people or dancing or junlping nlay be expected, the load model should be determined for special dynamic analysis. NOTE The procedure to be used may be given in the National annex. 12 BS EN 1991-1-1:2002 EN 1991-1-1:2002 (E) (4) When considering forklifts and helicopters, the additional loadings due to masses and inertial forces caused by fluctuating effects should be considered. These effects are taken into account by a dynamic magnification factor rp which is applied to the static load values, as shown in expression (6.3). (5)P Actions which cause significant acceleration of the structure or structural menlbers shall be classified as dynamic actions and shall be considered using a dynamic analysis. 13 BS EN 1991-1-1:2002 EN 1991-1-1:2002 (E) 3.1 General Section 3 Design situations (l)P The relevant permanent and imposed loads shall be determined for each design situation identified in accordance with EN 1990, 3.2. 3.2 Pernlanent loads (1) The total self-weight of structural and non-structural members should be taken into account in combinations of actions as a single action. NOTE See EN J 990 Table Al.2 (B) Note 3. For areas where it is intended to remove or add structural or non-structural elements, the critical load cases should be taken into account in the design. (3) The self-weight of new coatings and/or distribution conduits that are intended to be added after execution should be taken into account in design situations (see 5.2). (4)P The water level shall be taken into account for the relevant design situations. NOTE See EN 1997. (5) The source and moisture content of bulk materials should be considered in design situations of buildings used for storage purposes. NOTE The values for the densities provided in Annex A are for materials in the dry state. 3.3 Imposed loads 3.3.1 General (l)P For areas which are intended to be subjected to different categories of loadings the design shall consider the most critical load case. (2)P In design situations when imposed loads act simultaneously with other variable actions (e.g actions induced by wind, snow, cranes or machinery), the total imposed loads considered in the load case shall be considered as a single action. (3) Where the number of load variations or the effects of vibrations may cause fatigue, a fatigue load model should be established. (4) For structures susceptible to vibrations, dynamic lllodeis of imposed loads should be considered where relevant. The design procedure is given in EN 1990 clause 5.1.3. 14 3.3.2 Additional provisions for buildings BS EN 1991-1-1:2002 EN 1991-1-1:2002 (E) I§) (1) On roofs (particularly for category H roofs), ilnposed loads, need not be applied in combination with either snow loads and/or wind actions. @i] (2)P When the imposed load is considered as an accolnpanying action, in accordance with EN 1990, only one of the two factors lj/ (EN 1990, Table Al.1) and an (6.3.1.2 (11)) shall be applied. (3) For dynamic loads caused by machinery see EN 1991-3. (4) The imposed loads to be considered for serviceability limit state verifications should be specified in accordance with the service conditions and the requirements concerning the perfornlance of the structure. 15 BS EN 1991-1-1:2002 EN 1991-1-1:2002 (E) Section 4 Densities of construction and stored materials 4.1 General (1) Characteristic values of densities of construction and stored materials should be specified. Mean values should be used as characteristic values. See however 4.1 (2) and 4.1(3). NOTE Annex A gives mean values for densities and angles of repose for stored materials. When a range is given it is assumed that the mean value wil1 be highly dependent on the source of the material and may be selected considering each individual project. (2) For materials (e.g. new and innovative materials) which are not covered by the Tables in Annex A, the characteristic value of the density should be determined in accordance with EN 1990 clause 4.1.2 and agreed for each individual project. (3) Where materials are used with a significant scatter of densities e.g. due to their source, water content etc, the characteristic value of these densities should be assessed in accordance with EN 1990 clause 4.1.2. (4) If a reliable direct assessn1ent of the densities is carried out, then these values may be used. NOTE EN 1990 Annex D may be used. 16 BS EN 1991-1-1:2002 EN 1991-1-1:2002 (E) Section 5 Self-weight of construction works 5.1 Representation of actions (1) The self-weight of the construction works should in most cases, be represented by a single characteristic value and be calculated on the basis of the nominal dimensions and the characteristic values of the densities. (2) The self weight of the construction works includes the structure and non-structural elenlents including fixed services as well as the weight of earth and ballast. (3) Non-structural elements include: roofing; surfacing and coverings; partitions and linings; hand rails, safety barriers, parapets and kerbs; wall cladding; suspended ceilings thennal insulation; bridge furniture; fixed services (see 5.1.(4)). NOTE For information on fixed machinery see EN 1991-3. For other industrial equipment manufacturer shou1d be consu1ted.

B(2) The horizontal characteristic force F (in kN), normal to and uniformly distributed over any length of 1,5 m of a barrier for a car park, required to withstand the impact of a vehicle is given by: F = 0,5lnV2 I (8c + 8b) Where: In is the gross mass of the vehicle in (kg) v is the velocity of the vehicle (in mls) normal to the barrier Oc is the deformations of the vehicle (in mm) Ob is the deformations of the barrier (in mm) B(3) Where the car park has been designed on the basis that the gross mass of the vehicles using it will not exceed 2500 the following values are used to determine the force F: In = 1500 kg v = 4,5 mls Oc = 100 lnm unless better evidence is available. For a rigid barrier, for which ~ may be given as zero, the characteristic force F appropriate to vehicles up to 2500 kg gross mass is taken as 150 kN. B(4) Where the car park has been designed for vehicles whose gross mass exceeds 2500 kg the following values are used to determine the characteristic force F. In V 0:: = = = the actual mass of the vehicle for which the car park is designed (in kg) 4,5 mls 100 mm unless better evidence is available B(5) The force determined as in B (3) or B (4) may be considered to act at bumper height. In the case of car parks intended for vehicles whose gross mass does not exceed 2500 kg this height may be taken as 375 mm above the floor level. B(6) Barriers to access ramps of car parks have to withstand one half of the force determined in B (3) or B (4) acting at a height of 610 mm above the ramp. B(7) Opposite the ends of straight ramps intended for downward travel which exceed 20 m in length the barrier has to withstand twice the force determined in B (3) acting at a height of 610 nlm above the ramp. 43 BS EN 1991-1-1:2002 EN 1991-1-1:2002 (E) Bibliography ISO 2394 General principles on reliability for structures ISO 3898 Basis of design of structures - Notations.
