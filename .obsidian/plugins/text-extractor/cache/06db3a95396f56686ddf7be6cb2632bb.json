The book that pr ove s this is in you r han ds; it remain s on ly to con textualiz e my claim. Two w hol ly n ew urban isms have emerged to e n gage the circumstan ces of the twen ty-first cen tury: Tactical an d XL (or Extra Large). This pa irin g show s that Rem Kool haas’s pr escien t for mulation of S, M, L, an d XL pr oj ects is in com pl ete. It is missin g the XS: the Extra Small categor y repr esen ted by Tactical Urban ism. The architectural wor ld is curren tly fascin ated by the Extra Large (in fact, the March 2014 A r chitectur al R ecor d, arrivin g the very week I am writin g this, is dedicated to t he XL categor y). The XL are pr oj ects such as region al shoppi n g malls, so i mmen se an d com pl ex that they subsume urban ism. They are pr esumed to i n ten sify urban life. They certain ly pr ovi de an un pr eceden ted oppor tun ity for icon ic architecture, an d also t he oppor tun ity for the mos t spe ctacular failures. But even the icon ic successes of XL have bleak pr os pe cts. Mos t of the pr oj ects are cyn ical pa n derin gs to t he in securities of Asian an d Middle Eastern n ou veaux riches. As James Kun stler argues, they have n o f uture soc ially, ecol og ically, econ om ically, or pol itically. The XLs are in deed magn ificen t, but they are like din os aurs: Each is in dividually depe n den t on the acqu isition of ton s of fodde r, while the mammals survive by for agin g for ou n ces. Like the mammals, the XS Tactical in terven tion s can col lectively achieve the urban biom ass of an XL pr oj ect. The glamor ou s XLs are high-tech mon oc ultures subject to t he requ iremen ts for cheap e n ergy, assumed col lective behavior s, an d top- dow n pr ot oc ol s—all un sustain able. I som etimes thin k the CIA has recove red its vaun ted clevern ess to destroy America’s com pe titor s in Asia by embeddin g ou r megalom an iac XL design s in their cities an d equ ippi n g their kids in ou r architecture school s with econ om ically un sustain able an d soc ially catastroph ic urban design con cept s. As these beasts stumble an d wither, there will be greater wor ldwide in terest in Tactical Urban ism: decen traliz ed, bot tom -up, e xtraor din arily agile, n etwor ked, low - cos t, an d low -tech. It will be the urban pl an n in g equ ivalen t of the iPhon e repl acin g the main frame. Why did Tactical Urban ism emerge just n ow ? Because the Un ited States has already expe rien ced thos e awful ideas that are n ow bein g expor ted. Our con sultan ts do n ot build XL pr oj ects here, because we have learn ed n ot to t rust them. Our soc iety has created the an tibodi es that pr even t them: the pe rvasive NIMBYs an d in tractable bureaucracies con ceived to m ake such pr oj ects difficult, if n ot impos sible. How ever, so ba dly has ou r soc iety been damaged by these failures that n ow , even small pr oj ects becom e impos sible. The brillian ce of Tactical Urban ism is n ot just that it is an agile respon se to t he reduced circumstan ces of the twen ty-first cen tury but that it has turn ed the oppos ition , pr ivate an d pu blic, in to a mot ive. The frustrated an d frustratin g pr oc ess of pu blic pa rticipa tion begin s skept ically an d ten tatively an d then pi cks up a s con fiden ce is reestablished with Tactical Urban ist demon stration s. Tactical Urban ism is pu re American kn ow -how . It is the com mon sen se that hou sed, fed, an d pr os pe red an en tire con tin en t of pe n n iless immigran ts. We n eed to t hin k this way again —an d, may I add, with admiration that bot h XL an d XS requ ire a scurrilou s sen se of fun . Withou t that, you just won ’t get Tactical Urban ism. What a great filter for admission to s om e very good c om pa n y. André s Duany Preface A crisis is a terrible thin g to w aste. -Paul Rom er We started ou r firm, The Street Plan s Col labor ative, in the middle of the wor st econ om y either of us—an d ou r pa ren ts—had ever kn ow n . As a result, we treated ou r n ascen t com pa n y with frugal con servatism but on e that was gen erou s with ou r respe ctive com mun ities, with ou r time. So i t’s n o w on der that we discove red the Tactical Urban ism ethos in the wor k of thos e arou n d us, because we were usin g its cor e ph ilos oph y to i n cremen tally grow ou r busin ess. Our ambition was, an d remain s, to c om bin e pl an n in g an d design con sultin g with what ou r firm n ow calls research-advoc acy pr oj ects. To t his last poi n t, when we started ou r careers there was n o Y ou Tube, blog s an d Facebook were just becom in g a thin g, an d n o on e had heard of Twitter. Well, that’s all chan ged, an d qu ickly. We’ve n ever been so con n ected on lin e yet so f ar away in ou r com mun ities. But ou r curren t techn ol og y an d the ethos of ove rlappi n g ope n sou rce move men ts have pl ayed a pi vot al rol e in ou r ability to learn from ot hers an d in the dissemin ation of Tactical Urban ism. We’ll expl or e this key poi n t further in chapt er 3, bu t we wan t to m ake clear that althou gh this book com es with a pr ice tag, much of the in for mation con tain ed herein doe s n ot . An d for that we’re grateful. When you have fin ished readin g this book , we hope you feel empow ered.

We are n ow mor e excited than ever by the en dless n umber of creative pr oj ects that are emergin g daily, an d we believe stron gly that Tactical Urban ism en ables pe opl e to n ot on ly en vision chan ge but to h elp c reate it. This is pow erful stuff. Than ks for readin g. Mike’s Sto ry Letter writin g is the on ly device for com bin in g sol itude with good c om pa n y. -Lor d Byron With a pl an n in g degree fresh in han d, I left graduate school in An n Arbor , Michigan for Miami, Flor ida in 2007 t o r eturn to D uan y Plater-Zyberk an d Com pa n y, where I had in tern ed. I had wor ked pr imarily on Miami 21, a n effor t that en tailed repl acin g the city’s con vol uted an d archaic z on in g code with on e that streamlin ed the developm en t pr oc ess an d aimed for results mor e in lin e with twen ty-first-cen tury pl an n in g ideals: tran sit- or ien ted developm en t, green buildin gs, an d mor e sen sitive tran sition s between existin g sin gle-family n eighbor hoods an d fast-chan gin g com mercial cor ridor s. The pr oj ect—the largest appl ication of a for m-based code at the time an d maybe still—was in n ova tive an d com pl ex, a dream assign men t for a you n g an d idealistic pl an n er like me. Yet in the first few mon ths I began discove rin g the limitation of the pl an n er’s tool box , espe cially in con veyin g the techn ical aspe ct of the Miami 21 e ffor t to t he pu blic. I was still pa ssion ate abou t makin g a chan ge an d look ed for addition al oppor tun ities to i n fluen ce my n ewly adopt ed city. My lon ely 8- mile bicycle com mute from Miami Beach to M iami’s Little Havan a n eighbor hood s eemed like a good pl ace to s tart. At wor k I voi ced con cern s to m y col leagues that mor e cou ld be don e to m ake Miami a safe, in vitin g pl ace for cyclists, an d I was dedicatin g my free time to l oc al bicycle advoc acy. My bos s at the time, Eliz abeth Plater-Zyberk, heard me discussin g this at the of fice an d advised that I sen d an op- ed to t he Miam i H er al d expl ain in g why—an d how —the city shou ld impr ove con dition s for bicyclists. “Make Miami a Bicycle-Frien dly City” was the title of my December 2007 op- ed in the Miam i H er al d. In it I claimed that Miami was choos in g n ot to c om pe te with ot her leadin g American cities in attractin g an d retain in g talen t, en surin g low -cos t tran spor tation opt ion s, an d, ultimately, fulfillin g the lon g-term pr om ises of Miami 21. Amon g ot her ideas, I suggested that the city hire a bicycle coor din ator , un dertake a com pr ehen sive bicycle master pl an , an d shift pol icy to “ com pl ete its streets.” I also suggested that Miami cou ld adapt Bog ot á , Col om bia’s Cicloví a, a weekly livability in itiative that tran sfor ms appr ox imately 70 m iles (1 12 k m) of in tercon n ected streets in to lin ear pa rks that are free of mot or vehicles. Durin g this time I also s tarted blog gin g on the popu lar Tran sit Miami blog , where I met Ton y, an d wor ked clos ely with the n ewly for med Green Mobi lity Networ k advoc acy or gan iz ation an d Emerge Miami, a dedicated but loos ely or gan iz ed grou p of you n g pr of ession als look in g to m ake a pos itive impa ct. Tog ether ou r grou ps helpe d for m the city’s first Bicycle Action Com mittee an d created an action pl an that cou ld be adopt ed an d impl emen ted. To ou r amaz emen t, ou r ideas for makin g Miami easier to n avigate on bicycle were suppor ted by Mayor Man n y Diaz an d his staff, who vow ed to m ake Miami a much mor e bicycle-frien dly city. Highlights of the pl an in cluded obt ain in g a League of American Bicyclists Bicycle- Frien dly Com mun ity ratin g by 2012, pr ior ity in frastructure pr oj ects in lin e with upc om in g capi tal budget expe n ditures, an d the impl emen tation of Bike Miami Days, the city’s first Cicloví a-like even t. Whereas the first two t ook several years of pol icy an d ph ysical pl an n in g advan ces (the city received its bron z e design ation in 2012) , the Cicloví a-like even t—or what is n ow popu larly referred to i n Nor th America as “ope n streets”—ros e to t he top of the pr ior ity list because it was qu ick an d relatively in expe n sive. Plus, cou ld there be a mor e visible in itiative than clos in g of f dow n tow n Miami streets for soc ial an d ph ysical activity? To ou r delight, thou san ds of pe opl e show ed up t o t he first even t in Nove mber 2008, an d n ot just the spa n dex-clad MAMILs (Middle-Aged Men in Lycra) but en tire families, wom en of all ages, an d a lot of you n g adults. Peopl e were n ot just bicyclin g but also walkin g, jog gin g, skatin g, an d dan cin g alon g n or mally car-chok ed streets. The n ove lty of the even t created an almos t pa lpa ble, in tox icatin g en ergy on the street, an d the impa ct was immediate an d very visible. Furthermor e, the thou san ds of smilin g faces, ban n er sales for som e busin ess ow n ers, an d the n ot iceable absen ce of “carmageddon ” pu t a lot of pe opl e at ease, in cludin g the mayor , who g ave the welcom in g address befor e leadin g a ceremon ial bike ride alon g Flagler Street. As an even t, Bike Miami Days was a success. An d it served a much greater pu rpos e: It allow ed a few thou san d pa rticipa n ts to e xpe rien ce their city in an en tirely n ew an d excitin g way. It also g ave them a chan ce to i magin e a differen t urban future, on e where walkin g, bicyclin g, an d the pr ovi sion of mor e pu blic spa ce cou ld be made easier. We certain ly didn ’t call it Tactical Urban ism at the time, but that’s exactly what it was. I was hook ed. Bike Miami Days debuted in 2 0 0 8 . (Mike Lydo n ) The even t made me realiz e that I was frustrated n ot just with the lack of bicycle pl an n in g in Miami but with the field of urban pl an n in g. In deed, after 18 m on ths of wor kin g as a con sultan t, I had n ot seen an y of my wor k result in mean in gful, on -the- grou n d chan ge. Perhaps I’m impa tien t—som e say that’s also a gen eration al trait—but man y pl an n in g exercises qu ickly revealed themselves to be just that: expe n sive ways to discuss the pos sible, with impl emen tation pe rpe tually on hol d un til a time when the pol itics an d dol lars might align . Like mos t urban pl an n ers, I wen t in to t he pr of ession to m ake a pos itive an d visible differen ce in the wor ld. To m e, the goa l was always to do s o i n the n ear term, n ot “maybe later.” An d althou gh it was just a tempor ary even t, Bike Miami Days seemed mor e pow erful than an y pu blic wor kshop, c harrette, or meetin g I had atten ded. I remember thin kin g then , as I still believe toda y, that tran sfor mative in frastructure an d pl an n in g pr oj ects have their pl ace; n ew rail lin es, bridges, or the rez on in g of an en tire city are difficult but certain ly n ecessary an d impor tan t pr oj ects. How ever, you rarely get the buy-in n eeded throu gh the con ven tion al pl an n in g pr oc ess alon e. To be sure, a city can ’t respon d to i ts challen ges merely throu gh the exercise of pl an n in g for the lon g term; it must also m ove qu ickly on man y, man y smaller pr oj ects. In deed, these are the on es that en gage citiz en ry an d of ten make the big-ticket items pos sible in the lon g run . Cities n eed big pl an s but also s mall tactics. With this in min d, I began to s ee ope n streets in itiatives as a pos sible pl an n in g tool , an ot her way cities cou ld reach an d in spi re their citiz en s, an d a way for citiz en s to i n turn in spi re their gove rn men t to e mbrace chan ge. Bike Miami Days pr ove d to be a critical tactic for buildin g pu blic awaren ess an d in terest in the city’s in cipi en t bicyclin g strategy. In man y ways, it demon strated that there, hidden in pl ain sight, was a diverse con stituen cy of pe opl e searchin g for mor e oppor tun ities to be ph ysically active in pu blic spa ce. As tempor ary as it was, the streets became the man ifestation of what pl an n ers wou ld be lucky to c reate in years, n ot weeks. A few mon ths after the laun ch of Bike Miami Days, I was asked, alon gside Col lin Wor th, the city’s n ewly hired bicycle coor din ator , to c arry ou t Miami’s first bicycle master pl an . I really en joy ed my curren t job, bu t I embraced the oppor tun ity. I set up a hom e of fice, had a website built by a frien d of a frien d for a few hun dred dol lars, an d began doi n g busin ess as a sol e pr opr ietor un der the n ame The Street Plan s Col labor ative. After com pl etin g that pl an , I move d to B rook lyn , New Yor k. I had grow n in creasin gly en amor ed with the in ven tive wor k bein g un dertaken by the New Yor k City Depa rtmen t of Tran spor tation , led by Jan ette Sadik-Khan : hun dreds of miles of n ew bike lan es, several n ewly min ted “pi lot ” pe destrian pl az as, an d Summer Streets, the city’s version of Bike Miami Days. In spi red, I began to l ook arou n d for ot her activists an d com mun ities advan cin g what I saw as a healthy balan ce of pl an n in g and doi n g, leaders who l ook ed to i n stigate chan ge. Ton y an d I had wor ked tog ether for several years on Tran sit Miami, so w e decided to be com e pa rtn ers, an d in 2010 w e of ficially in cor por ated Street Plan s as a com pa n y. As the year pr og ressed, I con tin ued researchin g n ot on ly ope n streets pr og rams but a variety of shor t-term, of ten creative pr oj ects that were havin g a big impa ct on city pol icy an d city streets. That fall I traveled to N ew Orlean s for a retreat with a grou p of frien ds an d col leagues who s om etimes iden tify as “NextGen ,” a spi n of f of the Con gress for the New Urban ism. I shared n ot es on a grou n dswell of seemin gly un related low -cos t urban in terven tion s oc currin g acros s mid-recession America. With the pu rpos e of givin g mor e shape —an d a recog n iz able n ame—to t he ideas I shared in New Orlean s, we assembled Tac tical U r bani s m: Shor t-Ter m A ction, L ong- Ter m C hange , Vol ume 1, i n 201 1 a n d pr ovi ded the free digital doc umen t on SCRIBD. I pos ted the lin k on ou r com pa n y’s research web pa ge an d then sen t the lin k to m y col leagues an d left for a n eeded vacation . I wou ld have been happy if five or six of the twen ty or so N ew Orlean s retreat atten dees read the twen ty-five-pa ge book let. In less than 2 m on ths the doc umen t was viewed or dow n loa ded mor e than 10,000 times. Althou gh I was con fiden t Tactical Urban ism was a pot en tially pow erful an d discern ible tren d, the in terest exceeded all ou r expe ctation s. By the fall of 201 1 ou r com pa n y had move d from just doc umen tin g Tactical Urban ism to i n tegratin g it in to ou r pr of ession al pr actice. My frien d an d col league Aurash Khawarz ad suggested that we gather pe opl e tog ether to s hare in for mation , ideas, an d best pr actices. It was then that we decided to t est the in terest in Tactical Urban ism beyon d the digital realm. Soon thereafter, the Queen s-based arts col lective Flux Factor y len t us their even t spa ce in a con verted Lon g Islan d City greetin g card factor y, an d we pa rtn ered with n umerou s or gan iz ation s to pr odu ce the first Tactical Urban ism Salon . For n early 10 h ou rs, 150- pl us pe opl e from arou n d Nor th America discussed their pr oj ects, listen ed to ot hers, debated, an d dran k free beer. Further in spi red by the in terest an d blos som in g wor k of so m an y urban ists, we decided to w rite an d release Vol ume 2. We dou bled the n umber of case studies, in cluded a brief ove rview of Tactical Urban ism’s histor y, an d pr ovi ded a spe ctrum of un san ction ed to s an ction ed tactics; man y of the latter move d to t he for mer as we wrot e. Sin ce the Queen s even t, we’ve co- pr odu ced five mor e salon s in Philadelph ia, San tiago, M emph is, Lou isville, an d Bos ton . An d at the time of this writin g, the full series of pu blication s have been viewed or dow n loa ded mor e than 275,000 t imes by pe opl e in mor e than on e hun dred cou n tries.

(Isaac Kremer fo r Disco ver Do wn to wn Middlesbo ro ) To m y surpr ise, the simpl e act of writin g an op- ed has led to m an y great pe opl e, oppor tun ities, ideas, an d challen ges. It also pr ovi des pr oof that big thin gs can happe n when you start small. To n y’s Sto ry It was durin g a Memor ial Day weeken d trip t o N ew Yor k with my then 4- year-ol d son that I first started thin kin g abou t Tactical Urban ism. We had pl an n ed a spe cial father— son trip t o t he city, an d on e of ou r stops was a mega toy stor e in Times Squ are. Directly in fron t of this loc ation was where Broa dway had been con verted in to a pe destrian pl az a with lawn chairs an d or an ge pl astic barrels the very mor n in g we were there. It was a startlin g chan ge. After makin g ou r pu rchase an d leavin g the toy stor e, my son an d I settled in the n ewly for med pl az a. As som eon e who h ad lived in New Yor k for several years an d had been visitin g sin ce childhood, I n ever really sat in Times Squ are an d enj oy ed it. Not un til that day. The con version was so n ew that pe opl e were still crow din g the sidewalk an d un sure abou t how to i n teract with the spa ce. We were som e of the first that mor n in g who c on fiden tly steppe d of f the sidewalk an d sat dow n . Others fol low ed suit, but it was slow . We lin gered there for a while, pl ayin g with his n ew toy an d simpl y en joy in g the city—som ethin g that you cou ldn ’t really do be for e. The immediacy of it struck a chor d in me, n ot on ly because of my advoc acy expe rien ce in Miami with megapr oj ects such as Miami 21 a n d the half-cen t tran sit tax, but also be cause of my pr of ession al wor k an d the feelin g that it was n ear impos sible to get an ythin g don e. Here was a street retrof itted in to a pu blic spa ce that didn ’t take million s of dol lars an d a decade to c om pl ete. It felt qu ick an d easy an d was tot ally effective. This appr oa ch to pl an n in g reson ated with me. I had been tryin g to l ive in an urban con text in Miami sin ce my return from col lege at NYU, an d I fou n d the expe rien ce lackin g. I realiz ed that man y of the thin gs I had com e to l ove abou t livin g in a city were gon e, n amely great tran sit an d abun dan t pu blic spa ce opt ion s. Return in g to t he suburban campu s of the Un iversity of Miami, I wen t throu gh a major pe riod of urban ism withdrawal an d sou ght to e ducate myself abou t the city I love d an d try to m ake it in to mor e of the city I expe cted. I started to a tten d pu blic meetin gs, city com mission meetin gs, an d pl an n in g boa rd meetin gs an d to w rite letters to t he editor an d go t o a n y even t that had to do w ith in frastructure or the fun ction in g of the city. I immersed myself in the civic life of the city. I yearn ed for a better way to i n teract with my city gove rn men t an d make a substan tial con tribution to t he developm en t of the city, yet I fou n d few opt ion s ot her than bein g a mun icipa l empl oy ee or hired con sultan t. As a way of chan n elin g this civic en ergy, I started writin g for , an d wou ld later be the editor of , a loc al blog called Tran sit Miami that foc used on tran spor tation an d urban pl an n in g in Miami. Blog s were relatively n ew then , an ot her reflection of how techn ol og y was affectin g the city. Throu gh my writin g I became heavily in vol ved in the afor emen tion ed Miami 21 a ppr ova l pr oc ess, the impl emen tation of the 2002 h alf-cen t tran sit tax, an d the rise of bike culture in Miami. These expe rien ces crystaliz ed in my min d several ideas pr esen ted in this book . The first was how dysfun ction al the pu blic pl an n in g pr oc ess had becom e. I was excited abou t the pr os pe ct of my hom etow n havin g a n ew, for ward-thin kin g z on in g code . What I was n ot pr epa red for was how on erou s the appr ova l pr oc ess wou ld be for a code so l arge an d com pl ex. The pr oj ect had gon e throu gh hun dreds of pu blic meetin gs an d was sign ifican tly better than its pr edecessor yet was still attacked for bein g drafted behin d clos ed door s. Althou gh the resultin g for m-based code was ultimately appr ove d, it was the pr oc ess that had the greatest impa ct on me. No m atter how pr og ressive it was, a large pe rcen tage of pe opl e were again st the code (to s ay n ot hin g of the pe rcen tage who di dn ’t even un derstan d it), leadin g to de lays an d chan ges. Taken tog ether with the doz en s of lan d use attor n eys, develope rs, an d lobby ists, the appr ova l meetin gs were a diz z yin g circus of oppos ition . I kept won derin g, how can we en sure a sin cere an d thor ou gh pu blic pr oc ess, an d refor m large-scale z on in g systems, withou t havin g it turn in to t his? Arou n d the same time, Miami-Dade Cou n ty appr ove d a half-cen t sales tax that was in ten ded to f un d a greatly expa n ded Metror ail n etwor k. I was pr ou d to h ave vot ed for the item, yet several years pa ssed an d n o m ajor expa n sion was realiz ed. Althou gh there was full pu blic suppor t for the buildin g of 80 n ew miles of tran sit, there was little mun icipa l appe tite for impl emen tation of the cos tly system. A decade later, very little has been built, an d the region n eeds tran sit mor e than ever. The failure of the half-cen t tax of fered an ot her lesson : Megapr oj ects are n ot goi n g to s ol ve ou r pr obl ems, an d we n eed to f in d a wor karou n d to t he challen ge of buildin g an d retrof ittin g ou r cities to a lign mor e clos ely with the vision of pl an s such as Miami 21 i f they are to be successful. I began to s ee small-scale chan ges as pa rt of the an swer to t he stalled mom en tum of large pr oj ects. It was in the grow th of bicycle culture an d in frastructure in Miami that I first witn essed how small-scale chan ges can lead to l on ger-term results. From Bike Miami Days an d Critical Mass to t he grow th of bike in frastructure, there were a strin g of low - cos t pr oj ects that in dividually were n ot so i mpor tan t but tog ether con vin ced me that small, of ten shor t-term, easy-to- impl emen t pr oj ects cou ld have just as pow erful an impa ct on the culture of a city as the megapr oj ects. After grad school I wor ked at Chael Coope r & Assoc iates Architecture, takin g on bot h large-scale mixed-use developm en t pr oj ects an d small-scale residen tial pr oj ects. The same foc us on large pr oj ects that I witn essed in my advoc acy wor k was also pr esen t in my pr of ession al wor k; som e of the pr oj ects we wor ked on pr om ised to tran sfor m n eighbor hoods . Yet it turn ed ou t to be the smaller pr oj ects that were the mos t rewardin g because they were tan gible an d measurable in a very shor t time, whereas little at the larger scale was actually built. It was at this time that I took my son to N ew Yor k an d expe rien ced what we wou ld later call Tactical Urban ism firsthan d. After that trip I traveled for a urban design charrette an d became aware of the ways that in expe n sive, shor t-term sol ution s were bein g impl emen ted (because of either gove rn men t in action , the econ om y, or a lack of con sen sus). Back at hom e, fewer buildin g pr oj ects came in to t he of fice, an d I fou n d myself mor e excited abou t civic in vol vemen t an d street design than buildin gs. After a time I had a flou rishin g start-up t hat resulted from my vol un teer wor k in the com mun ity, an d I became clos er frien ds with Mike Lydon , havin g wor ked with him on Tran sit Miami for several years. We had a shared pa ssion for remakin g ou r cities, an d we bot h kn ew that the key to t hat tran sfor mation was the street. Soon after we embarked on ou r sol o c areers, we decided to be com e pa rtn ers an d for mally in cor por ated Street Plan s.

An d althou gh we kn ow that tactical pr oj ects alon e are n ot a pa n acea for ou r cities, the un derlyin g low -cos t an d iterative appr oa ch can be appl ied in a variety of ways to a ddress the challen ges of the com in g decades. Of cou rse, we kn ow that every city is n ot New Yor k or Miami, an d what we’ve learn ed from the man y pr oj ects we’ve wor ked on tog ether is that the challen ges affectin g ou r cities are just as n umerou s in the den se urban cor e as they are in ou r metropol itan suburbs.

Mer r iam -Webs ter ’s defin es tac tical as “of or relatin g to s mall-scale action s servin g a larger pu rpos e” or “adroi t in pl an n in g or man euverin g to a ccom pl ish a pu rpos e.” Tran slated to c ities, Tactical Urban ism is an appr oa ch to n eighbor hood bu ildin g an d activation usin g shor t-term, low -cos t, an d scalable in terven tion s an d pol icies. Tactical Urban ism is used by a ran ge of actor s, in cludin g gove rn men ts, busin ess an d n on pr of its, citizen grou ps , an d in dividuals. It makes use of ope n an d iterative developm en t pr oc esses, the efficien t use of resou rces, an d the creative pot en tial un leashed by soc ial in teraction . It is what Prof essor Nabeel Hamdi calls makin g pl an s withou t the usual pr epon deran ce of pl an n in g.1 In man y ways, Tactical Urban ism is a learn ed respon se to the slow an d siloe d con ven tion al city buildin g pr oc ess. For citizen s, it allow s the immediate reclamation , redesign , or repr og rammin g of pu blic spa ce. For develope rs or en trepr en eurs, it pr ovi des a mean s of col lectin g design in telligen ce from the market they in ten d to s erve. For advoc acy or gan ization s, it is a way to s how what is pos sible to garn er pu blic an d pol itical suppor t.

The for mer remain s the fixation of n umerou s an d ove rlappi n g discipl in es in the urban developm en t fields, which assume that mos t variables affectin g cities can be con trol led n ow an d in to the distan t future. The latter rejects this n ot ion an d embraces the dyn amism of cities.

How this is don e effectively is a foc us of this book . Of cou rse we recog n ize that n ot all city-buildin g effor ts len d themselves to t he tactical appr oa ches we ou tlin e in this book ; we don ’ t advoc ate usin g tempor ary materials to pi lot -test bridges or pr ot ot ype skyscrape rs. When don e well, large-scale pr oj ects can be catalytic, if n ot icon ic. The value of Tactical Urban ism is in breakin g throu gh the gridloc k of what we call the Big Plan n in g pr oc ess (a n od t o a uthor Nicco Mele’ s End of B ig thesis, which we’ ll expl or e further in chapt er 3 ) with in cremen tal pr oj ects an d pol icies that can be adjusted on the fly while n ever los in g sight of lon g- term an d large-scale goa ls.

(Pho to by Nin a Mun tean u, first ap p eared o n To ulo useLeTrek.co m) Tactical Urban ism can be used to i n itiate n ew pl aces or help r epa ir existin g on es. For exampl e, when Bos ton ’ s $22 bi llion “Big Dig” buried the Cen tral Artery expr essway an d made room for the 15- acre Ros e Ken n edy Green way, the n ew pu blic green spa ce n eeded to be activated.2 In a 2010 e ditor ial, the B os ton G lobe asserted, “What cou ld be a mon umen t to B os ton ’ s col lective spi rit is in stead a victim of the region ’ s pa roc hial rhythms.”3 Architecture critic Robe rt Campbe ll pu t it this way: “There are thin gs to l ook at but n ot hin g to do.” 4 In respon se to h is critiqu e, an d man y ot hers, the Ros e Ken n edy Green way Con servan cy began activatin g the for lor n spa ces; demon stration garden s, street art, food t rucks, an d low -cos t mova ble tables an d chairs have breathed n ew life in to t he green way. These low -cos t modi fication s were n ever pa rt of the master pl an pe r se but demon strate that impr ovi n g ot herwise lifeless pu blic spa ces n eed n ot cos t million s of dol lars. Tactical Urban ism is n ot alon e in its use of low er-cos t, iterative developm en t pr oc esses. The man ufacturin g in dustry, for exampl e, of ten hol ds up t he famed Toy ot a Way, which uses a con tin uou s impr ove men t pr oc ess to a chieve lon g-term goa ls.5 Similarly, tech en trepr en eurs look to t he ten ets of The Lean Start-Up, w hich is a pr odu ct developm en t method a dvoc atin g rapi d pr ot ot ypi n g as the in cept ion of the deliberately agile “Build—Measure— Learn ” pr odu ct developm en t cycle. The idea is that each revol ution qu ickly impr ove s on the last un til a pr odu ct is ready for the market, if on ly in beta for m.6 These con cept s have gain ed curren cy in ot her pr of ession al discipl in es in cludin g urban pl an n in g. We’ ll expl or e how these ideas relate to t he developm en t of n eighbor hoods in chapt ers 2 an d 5 . Throu gh ou r research an d wor k, we have iden tified a burgeon in g catalog ue of Tactical Urban ism pr oj ects that respon d to ou tdated pol icies an d pl an n in g pr oc esses with in n ova tive tran spor tation , ope n spa ce, an d small-scale buildin g in itiatives. These pr oj ects of ten result from the direct pa rticipa tion of citizen s in the creation an d activation of their n eighbor hood, or the creative wor k of for mal en tities, such as n on pr of its, develope rs, an d gove rn men t. Col lectively, they demon strate time an d again that shor t-term action can create lon g-term chan ge.

(Mike Lydo n ) Tactical Urban ism is frequ en tly appl ied to w hat urban soc iol og ist William “Hol ly” Whyte called the “huge reservoi r of spa ce yet un tappe d by imagin ation .”7 Toda y’ s reservoi rs—vacan t lot s, empt y stor efron ts, ove rly wide streets, highway un derpa sses, surface pa rkin g lot s, an d ot her un derused pu blic spa ces—remain pr om in en t in ou r tow n s an d cities an d have becom e the targets of en trepr en eurs, artists, for ward-thin kin g gove rn men t of ficials, an d civic-min ded “hacktivists.” Such grou ps in creasin gly view the city as a labor ator y for testin g ideas in real time, an d their action s have led to a variety of creative an d en trepr en eurial in itiatives realized in the rise of food t rucks, pop- up s tor es, better bloc k in itiatives, chair bom bin g, pa rklets, shippi n g con tain er markets, do- it-you rself (DIY) bike lan es, guerrilla garden s, an d ot her hallmarks of the Tactical Urban ism move men t.

A n d therein lies the seductive pow er of Tactical Urban ism: It creates tactile pr opos als for chan ge in stead of pl an s or com pu ter- gen erated ren derin gs that remain abstract. DIY Urban ism Versus Tactical Urban ism Life hackin g. Makin g. The En d of Expe rtise.

DIY urban ism blen ds a spi rit of en trepr en eurial activism with pu blic art, design , architecture, en gin eerin g, techn ol og y, an d n ot ion s of pr og ressive urban ism. So h ow do a ll these urban isms relate to t he on e that is the subject of this book ? It’ s simpl e: Not all DIY urban ism effor ts are tactical, an d n ot all Tactical Urban ism in itiatives are DIY. For exampl e, the in tern ation al pr actice of yarn bom bin g (the croc hetin g of street sign s, bike racks, statues, an d so on ) is a col or ful DIY act brin gin g creativity (an d pos sibly mildew) to a n y streetscape , yet it is n ot usually in ten ded to in stigate lon g-term chan ge, such as revisin g an ou tdated pol icy or respon din g to a deficien cy of in frastructure. We might describe it as a type of street art or oppor tun istic pl acemakin g but n ot Tactical Urban ism. Yarn bo mbin g can be a beautiful DIY imp ro vemen t, but it is gen erally n o t tactical. (Sq uid Tree by Lo rn a an d Jill Watt, 2 0 1 3 , kn itsfo rlife.co m/yarn -bo mbs) DIY Urban ism is the expr ession of the in dividual, or at mos t a small grou p of actor s, which can also de scribe Tactical Urban ism. How ever, we can n ot ign or e that Tactical Urban ism may also be in itiated by mun icipa l depa rtmen ts, gove rn men t, develope rs, an d n on pr of it or gan ization s to t est ideas or en act chan ge withou t delay. Althou gh these in itiatives of ten begin with smaller citizen advoc acy effor ts, the ben efits of Tactical Urban ism becom e clearer as they are in tegrated in to t he mun icipa l pr oj ect delivery pr oc ess an d capa bly brou ght to n eighbor hoods acros s the city. Con trary to i ts oc casion al por trayal as a you thful an d som ewhat ren egade move men t, Tactical Urban ism doe s n ot con sist sol ely of un san ction ed activity carried ou t un der the cloa k of n ight.

No m atter the in stigator , the appe al of Tactical Urban ism is that pe opl e of ten can ’ t tell the differen ce between the san ction ed an d un san ction ed pr oj ects an d simpl y appr eciate the human -cen tered appr oa ch at the heart of this burgeon in g move men t. Strategies Versus Tactics Com mon ly assoc iated with military ope ration s, s tr at egies an d tac tics are valuable terms for city buildin g. In urban pl an n in g, strategy is develope d throu gh master pl an n in g key pol icy or in frastructure advan cemen ts to obt ain soc ial, en viron men tal, an d/or econ om ic goa ls. Accom pl ishin g the goa l of reduced car depe n den cy, for exampl e, requ ires a strategy that may in clude a ran ge of pol icy chan ges, like allow in g den sity to in crease n ear tran sit station s. The strategy is made clear throu gh the pl an n in g pr oc ess, adopt ed by city leaders, an d then ideally move d to i mpl emen tation throu gh achievin g key obj ectives such as zon in g chan ges allow in g for mor e den sity.

(The Street Plan s Co llabo rative) Althou gh this appr oa ch doe s wor k in certain con texts, en tren ched in terests remain recalcitran t, ou tdated pol icy barriers stymie pr og ress, an d leadership voi ds leave well- con sidered pl an s, an d their strategies, on the shelf. This is why strategy for mulation is on ly half the battle. Plan n ers, develope rs, an d advoc ates alike n eed tactics that help grease the wheels for impl emen tation from the in side ou t an d the ou tside in . In this way, ou r un derstan din g of tactics depa rts from the obs ervation s of of t-cited urban ist an d Fren ch ph ilos oph er Michel de Certeau. In his semin al The P r ac tice of E ver yday L ife, de Certeau argues that strategies are the for mal tool of the pow erful (gove rn men t), an d tactics serve as the respon se of the weak (citizen s). Thos e wieldin g the for mer are con stan tly in com pe tition with thos e advan cin g the latter. The dialectic is relevan t to a n yon e in terested in obs ervin g how or din ary pe opl e alter the for m or use of the built en viron men t to s erve their ever- chan gin g n eeds. Som etimes referred to a s bricol age, this in for mal pr oc ess of small- scale citymakin g gives n eighbor hoods character an d is the subject of in qu iry by academics in terested in what’ s called “Everyday Urban ism.” Bro o klyn ’ s ubiq uito us n eighbo rho o d “street seats” are usually made fro m fo un d o bjects an d reclaimed materials. (Mike Lydo n ) Our view is that gove rn men ts can —an d shou ld—wor k mor e tactically, just as citizen s can learn to w or k mor e strategically. Strategies an d tactics are therefor e of equ al value an d shou ld be used in con cert with each ot her. Sure, the two a re of ten fou n d to be pu rsuin g differen t goa ls, but we’ re mor e in terested in how they can be used tog ether to m ove ou r cities for ward. We believe Tactical Urban ism is on e tool to do s o an d can pr oa ctively address the ten sion between bot tom -up a n d top- dow n pr oc esses by creatin g a better an d mor e respon sive en viron men t for all. How this may be don e is ou tlin ed in chapt er 5 . Tactician s are fo un d fro m the bo tto m up , the to p do wn , an d everythin g in between .

Of cou rse, equ ity is con textual an d broa d an d can be difficult to de fin e; what might be con sidered fair an d equ al for on e grou p m ay n ot be con sidered as such for an ot her. Still, when it com es to pr ovi din g equ al oppor tun ities for a wider ran ge of pe opl e to pa rticipa te in pu blic decision makin g, man y well-in ten tion ed an d fun ction ally ope n urban pl an n in g pr oc esses ten d to a ppe al to a pa rticular demog raph ic of pe opl e: thos e who a re educated, main tain an in terest in civic issues, an d, mos t impor tan tly, have spa re time.

Althou gh pu blic pl an n in g in itiatives will n ever com e clos e to obt ain in g 100 pe rcen t pa rticipa tion , well-executed Tactical Urban ism pr oj ects are on e way to br in g pl an n in g pr opos als an d con cept s to a wider audien ce (see Davis Squ are exampl e later in this chapt er).

In chapt er 3 , we discuss further the limitation s of pu blic in vol vemen t pr oc esses an d the rol e Tactical Urban ism can pl ay in widen in g the scope . Tactical Urban ism: Three Co mmo n Ap p licatio n s We have already men tion ed a variety of actor s who m ay use Tactical Urban ism an d a wide ran ge of goa ls that in terven tion s may help t hese actor s reach. The fol low in g three appl ication s are the on es that we have fou n d to be the mos t com mon . In itiated by citizen s to by pa ss the con ven tion al pr oj ect delivery pr oc ess an d cut throu gh mun icipa l bureaucracy by pr ot estin g, pr ot ot ypi n g, or visually demon stratin g the pos sibility of chan ge. This activity repr esen ts citizen s exercisin g their “right to t he city.” As a tool for city gove rn men t, develope rs or n on pr of its to m or e broa dly en gage the pu blic durin g pr oj ect pl an n in g, delivery, an d developm en t pr oc esses. As a “ph ase 0” early impl emen tation tool used by cities or develope rs to t est pr oj ects befor e a lon g-term in vestmen t is made. These three ways of usin g Tactical Urban ism are n ot mutually exclusive. In fact, of ten the first leads to t he secon d, which leads to t he third. The fol low in g section delves a bit deepe r in to e ach of these appl ication s an d pr ovi des exampl es. Citizen s Demo n s tr a tin g The Need fo r Cha n ge For citizen s, Tactical Urban ism is of ten used as an expr ession of civil disobe dien ce or simpl y as a way of gettin g thin gs don e withou t the burden of mun icipa l regulation or exten ded timelin e of pu blic pr oc ess. Targets typi cally in clude ou tdated pol icies or un desirable ph ysical con dition s. As with an y for m of pr ot est, the pow er is derived from the use of direct action to c om mun icate the desire an d pos sibility for chan ge. For exampl e, in a pa rk-in pe opl e tempor arily n arrow wide streets by pa rkin g their cars again st the curb in loc ation s where it is n or mally pr oh ibited. In 2013 B uffalo’ s Citizen s for Parkside Aven ue or gan ized the “Parkside Park-in ” at rush hou r to s low spe edin g traffic alon g the fou r-lan e thor ou ghfare.

I t’ s a n eighbor hood.” 1 1 As walkability becom es an in creasin gly impor tan t metric for measurin g the health of cities, “guerrilla cros swalks” have emerged as a tactic for n eighbor hood a ctivists fed up w ith the mon ths or years it may take to g et a few white lin es on the grou n d.

(Leslie Clague fo r the Po lish Hill Civic Asso ciatio n ) A To o l fo r Pub lic In vo lvemen t City pl an n ers an d ot hers are recog n izin g that Tactical Urban ism can help br idge the gap between cities an d develope rs an d citizen s in the urban developm en t pr oc ess. For ward- thin kin g city leaders in New Yor k City, for exampl e, have discove red that the use of tempor ary pi lot pr oj ects can help a llay NIMBY (n ot in my backyard) fears as the pos sibilities for chan ge are demon strated in the shor t term. Other cities are catchin g on too. W hen a streetscape pl an for the Davis Squ are n eighbor hood i n Som erville, Massachusetts was develope d in 2012 u sin g what chief pl an n er Geor ge Proa kis criticized as a con ven tion al top- dow n “design -pr esen t-defen d” method, a small n umber of “say n o t o e verythin g” n eighbor hood s takehol ders scuttled som e of the mos t log ical pu blic spa ce elemen ts in the pl an .

The goa l is to s how pe opl e differen t oppor tun ities in the real wor ld so t hat mor e in for med decision s may be made by a mor e diverse audien ce of pe opl e. An early Som erville by Design in itiative ou r firm was in vol ved with tran sfor med a very small pu blic pa rkin g lot in to a pu blic “pop- up pl aza” for 3 da ys.

After the 3 da ys were up, pu blic meetin gs, com men t cards pu t on every pl aza table, an d gen eral n eighbor hood bu zz made clear that there was much mor e suppor t from the pu blic to t ran sfor m the pa rkin g lot in to a pu blic spa ce. The city has sin ce begun that pr oc ess, pr ovi n g that truly pa rticipa tor y pl an n in g must go be yon d drawin g on flip c harts an d maps .

The catch was that each of the three teams had to de sign their pa rt of the pr oj ect usin g less than $10,000 w or th of materials so t hat the remain in g $10,000 cou ld be used for elemen ts that wou ld stitch the three pl an s in to on e hol istic pa rk.

Why Yo u Sho uld Keep Readin g Tac tical U r bani s m is of ten misused as a catchall to de scribe everythin g from pu b crawls to c halkboa rd message walls. Such activities shou ld n ot be discou raged—we wou ld n ever say “n o” to a good ba r hop—bu t we wan t this book to c larify what Tactical Urban ism is an d how you can appl y it effectively. For starters, Tactical Urban ism is n ot an of f-the-shelf sol ution or a list you r city can check of f to pr ove that it is respon sive to n ew ideas. Rather, Tactical Urban ism is a method f or tran sfor min g what en gin eer an d pl an n er Chuck Maroh n calls an or derly but dumb system in to on e that’ s mor e chaot ic but smart—on e that allow s emergen t n etwor ks of pe opl e an d their ideas to de velop qu ality-of -life impr ove men ts at the n eighbor hood scale. In this way, the stren gth is tied directly to t he pr oc ess: Tactical Urban ism allow s frequ en t cor rection s an d demon strates willin gn ess an d appr eciation for advan cin g ideas throu gh real-wor ld testin g. Results may vary, but the pr oc ess shou ld be trusted. In deed, it’ s akin to s om ethin g mos t of us learn by sixth grade: the scien tific method. The in heren t ten sion between the gove rn men t an d the gove rn ed is as ol d as cities themselves. This book is abou t how city leaders an d citizen s tog ether can create a mor e respon sive, efficien t, an d creative appr oa ch to n eighbor hood bu ildin g. Gove rn men t clearly doe s a wide ran ge of thin gs, man y of them well. How ever, the “silos of excellen ce” (as Maroh n calls them) develope d to a dmin ister the variou s gove rn men t city-buildin g services (e.g., pl an n in g, en gin eerin g, hou sin g, pu blic wor ks) have created a type of discor dan t gove rn men t sof tware (e.g., culture, code s, pol icy) that even tually tran slates to t he creation of the city’ s hardware (e.g., buildin gs, streets, pa rks). The cor e of this system has been in pl ace for almos t 100 y ears, an d in mos t com mun ities it is startin g to s how its age an d is due for an upg rade. The task of thos e in vol ved with buildin g tow n s an d cities toda y is to r ein tegrate the sof tware so t hat a better hardware con tin ues to e merge, on e that impr ove s the lives of residen ts an d the expe rien ce for visitor s an d leads to e con om ic success for busin ess ow n ers. That bein g said, the in heren t ten sion between the gove rn men t an d the gove rn ed is as ol d as cities themselves. Althou gh the term Tac tical U r bani s m is relatively n ew, man y of the pr oc esses, ideas, tactics, an d pr oj ects we share herein are n ot . Chapt er 2 highlights a half-doz en mom en ts in histor y to de mon strate how in for mal, mobi le, tempor ary, an d tactical city-buildin g in itiatives have con stan tly altered the soc ial, pol itical, econ om ic, an d ph ysical fabric of ou r cities. In chapt er 3 , we expl or e how the Great Recession an d the tren ds of return in g to t he city, a grow in g discon n ect with gove rn men t, an d the grow th of radical con n ectivity have suppor ted the rise of Tactical Urban ism in the twen ty-first cen tury. If n ot hin g stays the same, the qu estion becom es how the lesson s learn ed from the pr eviou s decade of fer in sight in to h ow urban developm en t will be shape d in the com in g years. We in clude man y in n ova tive an d in spi rin g pr oj ects throu ghou t the book , but chapt er 4 foc uses on five stor ies that best exempl ify the pow er of Tactical Urban ism: In tersection Repa ir, Guerrilla Wayfin din g, Build a Better Bloc k, Parkmakin g, an d Pavemen t to P lazas. These tactics may be familiar to s om e readers, but we’ re willin g to bet that even the mos t season ed Tactical Urban ist will discove r som ethin g n ew. In deed, each tactic has a com pe llin g or igin stor y that con textualizes why the pr oj ects were develope d, how they were executed, the lesson s learn ed throu gh impl emen tation , an d the impa ct they’ ve had loc ally, n ation ally, an d even in tern ation ally. Because thos e we pr of ile have in spi red so m an y great pr oj ects, fou r of the five stor ies also i n clude an exampl e from an ot her time an d pl ace, demon stratin g the scalability of these tactics. Given the seemin gly en dless variety of soc ial, ph ysical, an d cultural con texts for Tactical Urban ism pr oj ects, a sin gle of f-the-shelf how -to i s n ot con ceivable or advised. Mor eove r, the Tactical Urban ism tool kit is con stan tly evol vin g; we are con tin ually researchin g an d learn in g alon gside ou r pr oj ect pa rtn ers, pr actition ers, an d readers like you . But we do of fer ou r best an d mos t curren t advice for developi n g you r ow n pr oj ects in chapt er 5 . We’ ve fou n d that successful pr oj ects have elemen ts of a com mon appr oa ch that is align ed with the five pr in cipl es of Design Thin kin g. In this case, des ign refers n ot to obj ects pe r se but to a spe cific pr oc ess that shou ld be described as “an action , a verb n ot a n ou n .”1 6 The chapt er begin s with discussion abou t developi n g empa thy an d un derstan din g for you r en d users.

In the Con clusion , we reflect briefly on the Tactical Urban ism move men t an d challen ge you to u se the ideas in this book to t ake action in you r ow n tow n or city. Befor e we get on with it, we wan t to i mpr ess on you that Tactical Urban ism has very real limitation s. It’ s n ot the or even one sol ution for man y of ou r mos t vexin g urban pr obl ems. It can ’ t sol ve the affor dable hou sin g crisis facin g ou r mos t desirable cities, n or will it fix bridges in n eed of repa ir.

From pr ovi sion al Rom an military en campm en ts, to les bouqui ni s tes illegally sellin g book s alon g the ban ks of the Sein e in sixteen th-cen tury Paris, to t he tempor ary White City of the Chicago W or ld’s Fair of 1892, t he hallmarks of Tactical Urban ism have been in scribed in city-buildin g pa ttern s throu ghou t histor y.1 Toda y, the con vergen ce of several soc ial, econ om ic, an d techn ol og ical tren ds (discussed in chapt er 3 ) have led us an d man y ot hers to r ediscove r the ben efits of what we n ow call Tactical Urban ism. Ultimately, Tactical Urban ism describes the latest respon se to ou r basic human in stin cts: in cremen tal an d self-directed action tow ard in creasin g soc ial capi tal, econ om ic oppor tun ity, access to f ood, s afety from n atural an d human en emies, an d gen eral livability.

The histor ical pr eceden ts pr of iled in this chapt er are n ot com pr ehen sive or pe rfectly align ed, but they do s erve as in spi ration s for an d an teceden ts of Tactical Urban ism in terven tion s. The pr in cipl es are timeless. Human in gen uity aimed at impr ovi n g urban life kn ow s n o pr of ession , sector , or poi n ts alon g a histor ical timelin e. We’ll always have un met n eeds an d un expl oi ted oppor tun ities to e n han ce urban livin g. Thos e who address them directly, creatively, an d efficien tly will con tin ue to g uide us in the twen ty- first cen tury. The First Street Streets are the backbon e of a city an d its largest reservoi r of pu blic spa ce, so i t is n atural that we fou n d the spi rit of citizen -led urban ism in the iterative an d largely hor izon tal pr oc ess of creatin g what is believed to be the first urban street. The Neol ithic settlemen t of Khoi rok oi tia, on the islan d of Cypr us, was in habited from abou t 7,000 t o 3,000 b.c .e., pr edatin g the use of ceramic tool s by several thou san d years. At its height, the village hou sed between 300 a n d 600 i n habitan ts. The village con sisted of rou n d ston e structures of varyin g sizes fron tin g a lin ear street. The buildin gs an d the street tog ether for med a sin gle hilltop s tructure that was accessible on ly via a series of stairs an d walkways from below ; on e had to w alk up these access poi n ts to r each the tow n .2 When com pl eted, the street reached a len gth of 600 f eet (185 m eters). Built usin g roc ks qu arried from the Cypr ian hillside, the street was built to s erve the com mun ity’s mos t basic n eeds: com mun ication , mobi lity, trade, an d security. Its creation impl ies a n ew level of soph istication in soc ial col labor ation an d con struction . There was a larger pl an at wor k for bot h the street an d the village. In deed, the “street” was n ot just the leftove r spa ce between buildin gs but a structure in ten tion ally built up f rom the grou n d with con trol led poi n ts of access. Withou t an y for mal, ove rarchin g gove rn men t structure, Khoi rok oi tia’s residen ts were the on ly on es respon sible for the creation an d main ten an ce of the street. They un derstood i ts impor tan ce for the survival of the village.3 Un like in for mal pa ths, roa ds, or ot her ad hoc thor ou ghfares that almos t certain ly existed at the time, a com mon agreemen t was made in Khoi rok oi tia to e n sure that the ph ysical defin ition of the street wou ld remain in tact. In habitan ts were expe cted to respe ct the delin eation between the pu blic street an d the pr ivate residen ce, which we assume that they did successfully, as eviden ced by the fact that it remain ed in tact for thou san ds of years. An d with n o ot her pu blic spa ce in tern al to t he village, the street in trodu ced a soc ial fun ction : urban ism. The first “urban ” street was built in the Neo lithic settlemen t o f Kho iro ko itia, o n the islan d o f Cyp rus, in habited fro m abo ut 7 ,0 0 0 to 3 ,0 0 0 b.c.e. (By Op helia2 via Wikimedia Co mmo n s) Althou gh the village residen ts wou ldn ’t have con sidered it pl an n in g pe r se, the in ten tion al or gan ization of structures alon g a com mon artery in dicates on e of the first pu blic, citizen -led pl an n in g pr oc esses in histor y. Because theirs was a tow n of hun dreds (at the mos t), the task of bridgin g the gap be tween the n eeds of the pe opl e an d the Cou n cil of Elders was very small. The Cou n cil of Elders simpl y ove rsaw the pr oc ess n ot as rulers but as arbiters of con sen sus.4 Khoi rok oi tia’s street is a demon stration of the an cien t human impu lse to i mpr ove an d main tain the spa ce we in habit col lectively. The truth is that bot h for mal an d in for mal pr oc esses have impor tan t rol es to pl ay in the creation of a city. An d althou gh it’s easy to s ee how citizen s in a village of several hun dred can com e tog ether to bu ild a sin gle street, what happe n s to t his vern acular spi rit of citymakin g when a city is hom e to a hun dred thou san d or mor e pe opl e? It’s a qu estion an swered toda y in cities large an d small; the creation of streets for pe opl e has becom e an in fin itely mor e com pl ex en deavor sin ce the in trodu ction of man y tran spor tation mode s. How ever, the late 1960s exampl e of the first Dutch woone r f, described in the n ext section , an d the man y exampl es fou n d in chapt er 4 give us all hope that citizen s can an d will con tin ue to t ake back the street for its or igin al pu rpos e: walkin g, pl ayin g, sellin g, an d soc ializin g. Cities are for pe opl e. The Wo o n er f The in ven tion of the Dutch woone r f stan ds ou t because un like man y street design in n ova tion s from the last 100 y ears, it did n ot or igin ate from the pr of ession of traffic en gin eerin g but from citizen s seekin g to s low traffic in their com mun ity. Dutch for “livin g yard,” the woone r f is a residen tial street where pe opl e who a re n ot in cars are given pr ior ity ove r pe opl e who a re. This is accom pl ished by usin g ph ysical design to slow drivers dow n to a n ear walkin g spe ed so a s to n ot crash in to s trategically pl aced trees, bol lards, bike racks, an d ot her amen ities.5 The woone r f was created when a grou p of residen ts in the Dutch city of Delft grew frustrated with the grow in g pr obl ems related to s afety, con gestion , an d pol lution as car use in creased in their com pa ct an d ot herwise walkable city.6 The mun icipa lity’s lack of respon se in spi red a grou p of n eighbor s to t ear up por tion s of the pa vemen t on their street in the middle of the n ight so t hat cars had to m an euver arou n d the resultin g obs truction at low spe ed. This citizen -led, bot tom -up i n itiative in trodu ced a n ew street type to i n tern ation al audien ces, on e that return ed the street to t he citizen s for pl ayin g, walkin g, an d bicyclin g an d did n ot give the autom obi le pr ior ity. With little eviden ce that the in terven tion disrupt ed daily life, the mun icipa l gove rn men t qu ietly ign or ed the citizen -led in itiative an d advoc ates pu rsued its for mal accept an ce. In 1976 t he Dutch Parliamen t pa ssed regulation s in cor por atin g the woone r ven (pl ural) in to t he n ation al street design stan dards. Toda y the woone r f, or a similar for m of shared spa ce, is an in creasin gly accept ed traffic-calmin g measure ou tside Nor th America, an d it is un derstood by in tern ation al bodi es usin g stan dards an d en gin eerin g pr actices based on com mon pr of ession al pr actice. The Dutch wo o n er f—a street that acco mmo dates p edestrian s, bicyclists, an d p eo p le recreatin g, in additio n to cars— was first develo p ed by residen ts who to o k it up o n themselves to slo w traffic in their n eighbo rho o d. (Dick van Veen ) The in tern ation al accept an ce of the woone r f demon strates how un san ction ed, grassroot s activity can becom e san ction ed by bodi es of gove rn men t ove r time. We in trodu ced this idea—the way un san ction ed in n ova tion leads to s an ction ed pr actice—in chapt er 1 an d we’ll return to i t frequ en tly because it demon strates the impor tan ce of allow in g bot tom -up i n itiatives to i n for m the direction of top- dow n pr oc esses. The Ca s tr a Tactical Urban ism is able to s cale up w hen gove rn men ts choos e to f acilitate the pr in cipl es of qu ick an d efficien t urban developm en t. The creation of the urban street grid an d the resultin g bloc k pa ttern is on e strategy used histor ically in cen tralized, top- dow n pl an n in g effor ts to pr ovi de a framewor k for col lective, bot tom -up u rban ization . On e of the mos t well-kn ow n histor ical exampl es of this pr oc ess is the establishmen t of the Rom an cas tr a . Latin for “great legion ary en campm en t,” cas tr a was the term used for sites reserved for marchin g an d for bot h tempor ary an d pe rman en t military camps . The Rom an histor ian Flavius described it this way: As soon as they have marched in to a n en emy’s lan d, they do n ot begin to f ight till they have walled their camp a bou t; n or is the fen ce they raise rashly made, or un even ; n or do t hey all abide in it, n or do t hos e that are in it take their pl aces at ran dom ; but if it happe n s that the grou n d is un even , it is first leveled: their camp i s also f ou r-squ are by measure, an d carpe n ters are ready, in great n umbers, with their tool s, to e rect their buildin gs for them.7 Som e pe rman en t ston e buildin gs were built for spe cial uses, but the barracks in the camps were first built with tempor ary materials such as clot h (at least in pl aces with tempe rate climates such as Spa in ). Between pe riods of fightin g, the camps mor ph ed in to cen ters of com merce an d trade for loc al in habitan ts, an d ove r time the tempor ary structures gave way to m or e pe rman en t con struction . From Barcelon a to C arthage, cities arou n d Europe an d the Middle East or igin ated as tempor ary Rom an military camps created with a pa ttern of easily n avigable gridded streets.8 Lon don , on e of the mos t well-kn ow n exampl es, was in itially settled as a cas tr a arou n d a.d. 43. T he Rom an s in vaded En glan d an d traveled in lan d un til they reached the Thames River. Here they built a tempor ary woode n bridge, east of the pr esen t Lon don Bridge. Over time, the bridge, an d the framewor k established by the cas tr a , attracted settlers an d led to t he even tual grow th of the city. The Evo lutio n o f the Grid On e of the legacies of the Rom an cas tr a was the use of the grid as a way to e n cou rage spe edy lan d developm en t.9 This adapt able an d pr edicable urban grow th strategy became the de facto pa ttern for urban settlemen ts throu ghou t histor y, from the tow n s develope d un der the Laws of the In dies, to c ol on ial era American cities such as Savan n ah an d Philadelph ia. When William Pen n laid ou t a utopi an tow n for Philadelph ia in 1682, h e used a grid of streets an d bloc ks between the Delaware an d Schuylkill Rivers. His or igin al vision was for a “green e Cou n try Tow n e” of eighty 1- acre “gen tleman ’s estates” with man sion s surrou n ded by fields an d garden s spr ead even ly between the two r ivers. Yet Pen n was repe atedly rebuffed, because there was n o g ove rn men t to e n for ce the taxes he wan ted to l evy to pa y for the pl an . As on e accou n t states, “Because the Cou n cil met very in frequ en tly, an d because n o of ficials had an y pow er to a ct in the in terim, durin g these in tervals Pen n sylvan ia had almos t n o g ove rn men t at all—an d seemed n ot to s uffer from the expe rien ce.”1 0 In less than 20 y ears, the city grew in to a thrivin g com mercial cen ter despi te the lack of gove rn men t, an d ove r time the city’s lan dow n ers did n ot develop m an sion s on 1- acre lot s but in stead pr eferred the mor e econ om ical, den se pa ttern of mixed-use developm en t with attached tow n hou ses an d n arrow in terior streets that was n ot dissimilar from the urban ism man y had kn ow n in Lon don .1 1 Perhaps the first exampl e of this emergen t pa ttern was the con struction of Elfreth’s Alley, con sidered by som e to be the n ation ’s ol dest con tin uou sly in habited residen tial street. In 1702, c ol on ial blacksmiths Joh n Gilbert an d Arthur Wells, who ow n ed adjacen t lot s alon g the river, each ceded a por tion of his lot to bu ild a street alon g their pr ope rty lin e in or der to c on n ect their smithies n ear the river with Secon d Street, a thor ou ghfare that con n ected the grow in g city with poi n ts n or th, west, an d beyon d.1 2 This exampl e of semi-an archistic, col labor ative, pe er-to- pe er urban developm en t was a respon se to pr actical n eeds an d cou ld be con sidered an early exampl e of citizen -led in terven tion s in America, on e that is hard to i magin e in the culde-sacs of toda y’s suburbia. The No rth American Bun galo w We have show n that a n umber of bloc k-scale strategies can help f acilitate the creation of citizen -led, fin e-grain ed urban ism, but what abou t in dividual buildin gs? How have ou r edifices been created by either tempor ary, cen tralized pl an n in g effor ts or pe rman en t, citizen -led lan d developm en t? In the early twen tieth cen tury, urban grow th pr essure an d the n eed for accom pa n yin g in frastructure (streets, sewer, pow er, tran spor tation ) created a market for real estate develope rs to s ubdivide large tracts of lan d at the edge of a city. The tren d marked a shift in the way urban pr ope rty was develope d an d was made pos sible by the emergen ce of con ven ien t, pr ivately built street-car lin es that gave future residen ts access to t he dow n tow n empl oy men t base. The emergen t n eighbor hoods were master pl an n ed at on e time an d in cluded buildin g lot s for tightly pa cked sin gle-family hom es, apa rtmen ts, an d accessible retail, set within a grid pa ttern that mixed rectilin ear an d curvilin ear streets an d bloc ks. The American streetcar suburb was bor n , as was the era of develope r-led urban ization . On e o f the man y ho mes available by mail o rder fro m the Sears Ro ebuck Catalo g in 1 9 2 1 .

Licen sed un der p ublic do main via Wikimedia Co mmo n s) The streetcar suburb develope r was n ot un like thos e we kn ow toda y, but the developm en t framewor k was very differen t because it allow ed citizen s to pa rticipa te mor e directly in the grow th of their n eighbor hoods by buildin g catalog ue-bou ght bun galow cot tages an d hom es. For abou t $1,200 i n 1927 ( abou t $15,000 t oda y), a family cou ld buy a set of detailed bluepr in ts that came with a con struction man ual, an d within 2 w eeks the materials were shippe d so t hat they cou ld build their hom es. The develope rs did n ot build the hou se; they built the in frastructure arou n d the hou se an d sol d the lan d. Because this system pr edated the full-scale adopt ion of mun icipa l zon in g an d lan d developm en t regulation , there were few bureaucratic hurdles to j ump, w hich kept cos ts low er for everyon e.

In shor t, they brou ght a broa der n eighbor hood de velopm en t pl an to l ife qu ickly.1 5 In man y ways, the pr ol iferation of mail-or der hou ses as an urban tactic can be seen as the pr edecessor to t he globa l distribution of toda y’s con tempor ary tactical in terven tion s dissemin ated throu gh on lin e how -to m an uals, guides, an d You Tube videos .

The surge of in terest in shippi n g-con tain er con struction toda y also t akes its cue from this early twen tieth-cen tury exampl e of cheap but easily custom izable an d built urban fabric. The Wo rld’S Fair On the ot her en d of the spe ctrum of buildin gs that reflect Tactical Urban ist values are large-scale tempor ary structures an d mon umen ts, such as thos e that result from the Wor ld’s Fairs. The built legacy of man y of these even ts is n ot in the large-scale developm en t that characterizes them but in the pu blic spa ces an d buildin gs that they leave behin d, which for m pa rt of the curren t fabric of cities such as Paris, New Yor k, Chicago, a n d St. Lou is. In itiated in 1851 a n d still active toda y, the Wor ld’s Fair, or Wor ld’s Expos ition , is a pu blic expos ition hos ted by a differen t city every few years that con tain s an en semble of exhibition pa vilion s, mon umen ts, an d cultural activities. The expos can last from 2 t o 6 mon ths an d show case cultural, com mercial, an d techn ol og ical assets from differen t cou n tries within a large tempor ary urban framewor k built by the hos t cou n try. An d in the wor ld befor e the In tern et, the Wor ld’s Fair was seen by its pa rticipa n ts as an impor tan t way to c on vey cultural, com mercial, an d techn ol og ical in for mation on a globa l scale. The man y Wor ld’s Fair sites became the testin g grou n ds for top- dow n urban expe rimen tation by gove rn men t. It is on e of the on ly in stan ces, besides the Olympi c Games, in which a gove rn men t is allow ed to s pe n d un tol d sums of mon ey on tempor ary architecture an d urban ism. In the con text of usin g shor t-term action to c reate lon g-term chan ge, it’s n ot the expos ition s themselves that are relevan t to t he discussion of Tactical Urban ism but the urgen cy to g et thin gs don e qu ickly that for ces the con struction of buildin gs, in frastructure, pa rks, an d mon umen ts that of ten lead to l astin g impr ove men ts. On e of the mos t well-kn ow n exampl es is the Eiffel Tow er, built for the Expos ition Un iverselle in Paris in 1889. W hat is n ow con sidered an in tern ation al symbol for Fren ch culture an d Parisian urban life was in ten ded to be a tempor ary in stallation highlightin g techn ol og ical advan cemen ts in the use of iron . Similar lan dmarks with stayin g pow er in clude the Seattle Spa ce Needle (1962) an d the Queen s Un isph ere (1964) . Amon g the mos t in fluen tial Wor ld’s Fairs was the 1893 C ol umbian Wor ld Expos ition in Chicago. T he expos ition was held in 1893 t o c om memor ate the 400t h an n iversary of the arrival of Christoph er Col umbus in the New Wor ld. The fair cove red mor e than 600 a cres in Jackson Park an d the Midway Plaisan ce an d was design ed by som e of the n ation ’s greatest pl an n ers, architects, an d lan dscape architects, in cludin g Dan iel Burn ham, Lou is Sullivan , Geor ge B.

Appr ox imately 200 t empor ary buildin gs design ed in the Beaux-Arts style were con structed with wood, c ove red with white stucco, a n d lin ed with the recen t in n ova tion of altern ate-curren t lightbulbs, which when illumin ated at n ight gave the expos ition its mon iker “The White City.” Mor e than 27 m illion pe opl e atten ded the fair durin g the 6 mon ths that it was ope n , the n umbers secon d on ly to t he Expos ition Un iverselle in Paris, which was ope n a full 6 m on ths lon ger.

It was written that the “White City repr esen ted itself as a repr esen tation , an admitted sham.

Created in 1865, t he pa rk was impr ove d on when it was chos en as the site of the 1915 P an ama– Califor n ia Expos ition , an d again with the 1935 C alifor n ia Pacific In tern ation al Expos ition . Not able amon g these impr ove men ts are the Cabrillo B ridge con n ectin g the pa rk with the surrou n din g street n etwor k, the design of man y for mal garden s an d pu blic spa ces by Fran k Lloy d Wright, an d doz en s of pu blic buildin gs an d pa vilion s that still exist toda y. In an ticipa tion of the cen ten n ial celebration of the 1915 P an ama–Califor n ia Expos ition , a n ew master pl an was drafted for the pa rk in 201 1. A key recom men dation called for restor in g the Plaza de Pan ama in fron t of the San Diego M useum in to a true pe destrian pl aza. For years the pl aza was used as a large surface pa rkin g lot , marrin g the heart of the ot herwise great civic spa ce. To m ain tain pa rkin g suppl y, the pl an called for the con struction of a n ew pa rkin g garage in addition to ot her pa rk upg rades. Faced with pol itical an d legal challen ges, the con trove rsial $45 m illion pr oj ect was tabled in favor of a cheape r, iterative appr oa ch estimated to c os t 1 pe rcen t as much. Because the pa rkin g was n ot thou ght to be crucial in the n ear term, the city pa in ted the grou n d an attractive light tan col or , pu t ou t som e pl an ters, an d com mitted to s eein g what wou ld happe n . Mot or ists cou ld still circulate slow ly throu gh on e pa rt of the reclaimed pl aza, but the in tegrity of this for merly gran d pu blic spa ce was almos t in stan tly restor ed. Capt urin g the spi rit of Tactical Urban ism, the city’s for mer mayor said at the time, “If a certain elemen t doe sn ’t wor k the city can try som ethin g else.”1 9 The Plaza de Pan ama was used as a large surface p arkin g lo t fo r years. (Ho ward Blackso n ) Aban do n in g a much mo re co stly lo n g-term p lan , the City o f San Diego turn ed the Plaza de Pan ama in to a true p edestrian p laza usin g lo w-co st materials. (Ho ward Blackso n ) Despi te som e in itial con trove rsy ove r the pot en tial impa ct on pa rk an d museum atten dan ce, the con version of the pl aza led to r ecor d-settin g atten dan ce at the Timken Museum. The result has been a resou n din g success accor din g to city pl an n ers, with residen ts deman din g even mor e pr og rammin g for the spa ce. The city is pu rsuin g pl an s for a scaled-back cen ten n ial celebration , with n ew lightin g arou n d the pl aza, while the pe rman en t redesign is on hol d. Play Streets Street fairs an d bazaars, markets, bloc k pa rties, an d similar tempor ary even ts have brou ght life to s treets for millen n ia, pr ovi n g that ou r thor ou gh-fares fulfill a rich soc ial an d econ om ic pu rpos e as much as a utilitarian on e. Un for tun ately, in the early 1900s the n ascen t traffic en gin eerin g pr of ession , autom obi le man ufacturers, oi l pr odu cers, an d in suran ce com pa n ies col lectively hijacked ou r streets for a cen tury of relen tless mot or in g. Yet almos t as soon as cars began dom in atin g urban streets, tactical in terven tion s were or gan ized to t ake them back, even if on ly tempor arily. At the dawn of the mot or in g age, crow ded con dition s an d the lack of urban pa rk spa ce mean t that streets were the pr in cipa l pl ace of pl ay for children an d the pr imary soc ial spa ce for adults. The in trodu ction of the autom obi le to c ity streets clashed with this culture an d qu ickly led to a spi ke in child fatalities, amon g ot her maladies. The idea of creatin g tempor ary pl ay streets—clos in g a few bloc ks to a utom obi le traffic so t hat kids cou ld pl ay safely—emerged from pol ice depa rtmen ts as a tactic to k eep c hildren safe in urban cen ters such as New Yor k an d Lon don . In 1909, t he New Yor k T imes repor ted that the city’s pol ice com mission er had drafted a pl an for a pi lot pr oj ect to r egulate traffic for the pr ot ection of pe destrian s, pa rticularly children (n ot dissimilar from the pi lot pr oj ects cities impl emen t toda y). The New Yor k City Parks an d Playgrou n ds Assoc iation helpe d design the pr og ram to “ be of mutual ben efit to dr ivers an d pe destrian s” by pr oh ibitin g traffic durin g after-school hou rs on certain bloc ks “where the popu lation is the thickest.” Children were able to have a safe area to pl ay while leavin g n eighbor in g bloc ks clear for “bot h carters an d chauffeurs” to dr ive.2 0 The n ew pi lot pr og ram took in to c on sideration such factor s as whether busin esses wou ld be hurt by the street clos in g, whether the street had a large n umber of ten emen ts or residen ts, an d whether the traffic was favor ably light (38 w agon s every 5 m in utes or 25 a utom obi les an hou r was con sidered heavy traffic). The New Yor k T imes read, While a hot , asph alted, treeless bloc k doe s n ot make a beautiful pl aygrou n d, with the cartin g barred after school hou rs, they wou ld at least be safe an d in expe n sive an d clear the n eighbor in g streets of the you n gsters. If trees cou ld be pl an ted on thos e same selected bloc ks in the con gested n eighbor hoods , the advoc ates of this n ew traffic regulation scheme believe that a pr actical way of securin g adequ ate pl ay spa ce at very little cos t will have been fou n d. In deed, the tempor ary repu rpos in g of the street pr ove d to be a very qu ick an d low - cos t method t o m ain tain the recreation areas an d ou tdoor pl ay spa ces for n eighbor hood you th while also r eclaimin g the soc ial life of n eighbor hoods . Buildin g from the success of the early pi lot pr oj ects, the New Yor k City Pol ice Athletic League established a summer pl ay streets pr og ram in 1914, w hich in cluded supe rvised areas for children to pl ay spor ts an d games an d take pa rt in cultural activities. Pol ice com mission er Arthur Woods set aside twen ty-n in e city bloc ks in Man hattan where traffic was pr oh ibited in the aftern oon s on every day except Sun day. In 1916, a New Yor k City pol ice of ficer, in defen se of pl ay streets, tol d the New Yor k Times , “It is on ly n atural that children shou ld wan t to pl ay an d if the city refuses to pr ovi de pl aygrou n ds for them, they are goi n g to pl ay in the streets.” The same article repor ted that the obj ective of the pl ay streets was to “ reduce the tempt ation s of wron gdoi n gs by keepi n g children of f the streets an d by givin g them a chan ce for whol esom e pl ay un der pr ope r supe rvision .” Because of the success an d scalability of the in itial pr og ram, twen ty-five pl ay streets were created by 1921, a n d an ot her fifty were added in Brook lyn , the Bron x, an d Queen s soon thereafter. Despi te their popu larity, pl ay streets pr og rams in New Yor k City an d elsewhere n early wen t extin ct with risin g autom obi le use an d suburban ization . How ever, toda y they have reemerged as a tool to c om bat the n egative impa cts cars have on ou r cities. How ever, this time arou n d con cern ed citizen s are of ten leadin g the effor t. In En glan d, which on ce had hun dreds of pl ay street pr og rams pa ttern ed after thos e fou n d in New Yor k City in the early twen tieth cen tury, citizen -led effor ts have led to pol icy chan ges. For exampl e, in 201 1 a grou p of con cern ed pa ren ts in Bristol , En glan d appr opr iated legislation design ed for street pa rties to c los e their street to c ars so t hat their children cou ld pl ay safely.2 1 Within mon ths, the Bristol City Cou n cil recog n ized the ben efits an d in trodu ced a n ew pol icy allow in g residen ts to c los e streets to t raffic for up t o 3 h ou rs a week for children ’s pl ay.

Suppor ted by a $1,000 g ran t from the San Fran cisco M useum of Art, Sherk design ed an d impl emen ted a series of por table pa rks at three loc ation s in San Fran cisco ove r the spa n of 4 da ys. The in stallation s were loc ated on top of an d below freeway on -ramps an d on Maiden Lan e in dow n tow n San Fran cisco. T hey in cluded whimsical elemen ts such as farm an imals (bor row ed from the city’s zoo) , pa lm trees, thick sod, a n d ben ches, which “had the startlin g impa ct of real life Magrittean mirages.”2 3 Part art an d pa rt pr ot est, the in terven tion was n ot on ly ahead of its time but repr esen tative of the pr actice of resistan ce that also i n for med the n ascen t Bay Area culture of hackin g that gave rise to pe rson al com pu tin g. “Bon n ie Ora Sherk’s first pu blic artwor k tempor arily revitalized the dead, mechan istic urban spa ces of San Fran cisco t hrou gh ‘bucol ic demon stration s’ in the for m of por table pa rks featurin g pl an ts an d an imals,” said curator Tan ya Zimbardo.

An d when we in qu ired abou t how she dealt with city’s respon se to h er pr oj ect, Sherk expl ain ed that because it was un usual at the time, there were n o pr ot oc ol s in pl ace to s ay “n o.” She merely had to obt ain an “en croa chmen t pe rmit” from Caltran s to pl ace a por table pa rk on top of an d below the freeway, a task that wou ld n ot be so s impl e toda y.2 4 A recen t resurgen ce of in terest in 1970s in terven tion s such as Sherk’s has coi n cided with a grow in g foc us amon g a n ew gen eration of artists on tempor ary in stallation s that fuse en viron men talism an d urban pl an n in g to de mon strate how tempor ary pu blic art in stallation s can in spi re impr ove men ts to i n frastructure.2 5 Bo n n ie Ora Sherk, a San Fran cisco an d New Yo rk City–based artist an d lan dscap e architect, develo p ed a series o f p ublic sp ace in stallatio n s in San Fran cisco in the early 1 9 7 0 s that p ro vided co mmen tary o n the city’s lack o f green sp ace.

In the fol low in g exampl es, we’ll describe how small-scale mobi le activities, either for civic pa rticipa tion or com merce, can have a big impa ct on how pu blic spa ces are used. Mo bile Libraries From city hall to m un icipa l libraries, pu blic services have existed in mobi le for m throu ghou t histor y. Whereas toda y’s mobi le libraries take shape as trucks, van s, or buses, pa st iteration s in clude bicycle, wagon , don key cart, camel, mot or bike, boa t, helicopt er, an d train . No m atter the mode , each relied on bot h the stewardship of a top- dow n en tity—a mun icipa lity, n on pr of it or gan ization , or in som e cases wealthy in dividuals—an d the citizen s who pa tron ized the services pr ovi ded. Som e of the earliest exampl es of mobi le libraries were develope d in Victor ian En glan d. In the Cumberlan d region , ph ilan thropi st Geor ge Moor e started a mobi le pu shcart library, which traveled between eight differen t tow n s droppi n g of f an d pi ckin g up book s. Con sisten t with Victor ian ideals of self-impr ove men t an d soc ial mobi lity, an article from this era describes the best pr actices assoc iated with the mobi le library so that ot hers cou ld “diffuse good l iterature amon g the rural popu lation .”2 6 An ot her early exampl e, from 1858, i n vol ved the Mechan ics In stitute of Warrin gton , En glan d.

In the Un ited States, the tradition of mobi le libraries began at the turn of the n in eteen th cen tury. Librarian Mary L.

This effor t was fol low ed by a mobi le book delivery service that even tually reached every cor n er of the rural cou n ty via a hor se- drawn buggy with book s from the Hagerstow n , Marylan d Public Library.

What mos t visitor s don ’t kn ow is that these book sellers, called les bouqui ni s tes , have been pe ddlin g bestsellers sin ce the 1500s . Their pr esen ce toda y repr esen ts a 500- year timelin e of com mercial activity that is n ow regulated an d in stitution alized by the City of Paris. How ever, this wasn ’t always the case. Les bouqui ni s tes began sellin g book s ou t of wheelbarrow s alon g the ban ks of the Sein e, on ly to l ater expa n d to t he man y bridges arou n d the city. As busin ess impr ove d, the wheelbarrow s gave way to s mall, green stalls that were pl aced on top of the ston e river emban kmen ts with leather straps . Their early com mercial success did n ot go un n ot iced. As early as 1557, t he mun icipa l gove rn men t categor ized man y of les bouqui ni s tes as thieves because they sol d for bidden Prot estan t pa mph lets durin g the Wars of Religion .3 1 Despi te their repu tation , les bouqui ni s tes oc cupi ed man y bridges arou n d the city durin g the seven teen th cen tury, mos t n ot ably the Pon t Neuf, which led to c on flicts with the established merchan ts loc ated n earby, who of ten chased them from the area. Similar to br ick-an d-mor tar restauran ts den ou n cin g toda y’s food t rucks, book stor e ow n ers com pl ain ed lou dly en ou gh to h ave the tempor ary book sellers ban n ed in 1649. H ow ever, these pe rsisten t en trepr en eurs wou ldn ’t be deterred. After the Fren ch Revol ution (1789–1799) , the pr ivate libraries of man y Fren ch n obl es an d clergymen were loot ed an d democ ratized by les bouqui ni s tes , makin g them mor e popu lar than ever.3 2 Althou gh their popu larity again attracted the ire of stor eow n ers, the city even tually legalized their pr esen ce in the 1850s . The n ew regulation s con fin ed them to s pe cific loc ation s, limited their activity to S un days or hol idays when the book shops were clos ed, an d stipu lated that each “shop” must col laps e in to a box at day’s en d; les bouqui ni s tes were asked to ope rate a literal pop- up s hop. By the turn of the n in eteen th cen tury, they were allow ed to pe rman en tly attach the box es to t he riverban k, an d by 1930 t he dimen sion s of the box es an d the n umber of licen ses issued were stan dardized. This slow pr og ression from un san ction ed to san ction ed activity show s that a successful mode l will survive an d thrive despi te the vicissitudes of mun icipa l pol itics. The triumph of les bouqui ni s tes may be attributed to t heir loc ation an d con sisten cy. In deed, as a daily oc curren ce they became a com mon if n ot belove d pa rt of the city’s soc ial, econ om ic, an d ph ysical fabric.

On the roa d for mon ths at a time, campi n g in isol ated loc ation s with n o ot her opt ion s for food pr epa ration or stor age, cattlemen n eeded foods that were easy to pr eserve, such as cof fee, cor n meal, dried bean s, an d salted meats. The chuckwagon s also i n cluded pr ovi sion s such as tables, uten sils, spi ces, first aid suppl ies, an d a slin g for kin dlin g, which allow ed cattlemen to c ook food. T he chuckwagon also s erved a soc ial pu rpos e for the n om adic cattlemen , who h ad n o ot her ph ysical framewor k arou n d which to g ather after wor k: The chuckwagon pr ovi ded a loc ation for cattlemen to con gregate an d for m a com mun ity. The chuckwagon was a n imble respon se servin g thos e n eedin g access to c on ven ien t food a n d pr ovi sion s while wor kin g or travelin g in remot e areas. The rise of food t rucks in urban areas was a similar respon se, albeit for an en tirely differen t con text. In the 1870s , late-n ight food opt ion s were almos t n on existen t in urban areas. Seein g a market that wasn ’t bein g catered to, n ewspa pe rman Walter Scot t of Provi den ce, Rhode Islan d develope d a freight wagon that hou sed a din er. Kn ow n as the “first restauran t on wheels,” the hor se-drawn din er was station ed ou tside the Pr ov idenc e J our nal of fices an d sol d pr epa red food t o w or kers on the n ight shift an d pa tron s of n earby gen tlemen ’s clubs (or an yon e ou t between dusk an d dawn ).3 4 Like the chuckwagon , Scot t’s din er is also c on sidered an early pr edecessor of the mode rn food t ruck an d is widely believed to be the first din er in the Un ited States, a catalyst for the wor kaday lun ch car an d din er move men t that swept throu gh mos t of America.

Between 1900 an d 1960 f ood t rucks became a fixture in American cities an d suburbs, from the familiar Good H umor ice cream truck or the Oscar Mayer “Wien ermobi le” to l ess well-kn ow n exampl es such as the mobi le hot waffle carts of New Orlean s. The risin g popu larity of food t rucks, similar to t he expe rien ce of les bouqui ni s tes , was n ot withou t ten sion from restaurateurs who f eared com pe tition an d mun icipa l gove rn men ts that didn ’t kn ow qu ite how to r egulate them. Haven Bro thers to day, in Pro viden ce, RI. (Mike Lydo n ) Mun icipa l gove rn men ts wor ked to r egulate an d con trol the grow th of the food t ruck an d mobi le food ph en om en a. Officials in Los An geles in itially tried to ba n food c arts in the 1890s , on ly to f in d their popu larity boom . The city soon chan ged cou rse, choos in g tighter regulation s rather than ou tright pr oh ibition by requ irin g that they clos e at a reason able hou r because they attracted late-n ight revelers as the bars clos ed dow n . On e article from the Los A nge les T imes described how the city’s robu st street food s cen e look ed to ou tsiders. “Stran gers com in g to L os An geles remark at the pr esen ce of so man y ou tdoor restauran ts, an d marvel at the system which pe rmits men … to s et up pl aces of busin ess in the pu blic streets … com pe tin g with busin essmen who pa y high ren ts for room s in which to s erve the pu blic with food.” 3 7 As American culin ary tastes expa n ded, so di d the of ferin gs of food t rucks. In Los An geles, Mexican immigran ts began brin gin g their culin ary tradition s to C alifor n ia in the late 1800s . With scarce resou rces they opt ed for the low -cos t an d mor e n imble mobi le version of a brick-an d-mor tar restauran t. Althou gh man y urban food t rucks have of fered Mexican fare histor ically in Los An geles, Raul Martin ez, who i s con sidered the father of the city’s thrivin g taco t ruck ecos ystem, best exempl ifies the pa th to s uccess. In 1974 M artin ez con verted an ice cream truck in to a taco t ruck an d pa rked it ou t-side an East Los An geles bar. He was so successful that it took him on ly 6 m on ths to e stablish his first Taco K in g restauran t loc ation . By 1987, h e had built a min i restauran t empi re with $10 m illion in sales, in addition to t hree 40- foot taco t rucks an d ten taco s tan ds that helpe d him reach markets all ove r Los An geles.3 8 The Taco K in g on ce again demon strates how Tactical Urban ism is as much an econ om ic developm en t en gin e as a pa radigm for urban pl an n in g an d pl acemakin g; the low start-up c os t of the food t ruck allow s en trepr en eurs to g et a foot hol d in the market, allow in g them to by pa ss the econ om ic an d regulator y burden s of the con ven tion al restauran t busin ess while they grow a custom er base. This reality was on full view in the pos t-recession food t ruck boom , which was spa rked by a glut of recen tly laid-of f gou rmet chefs an d failed restauran t ow n ers who f ou n d a market for their skills in the food t ruck busin ess an d n early in stan t fol low in gs via Twitter. Their success in this low - en try-barrier busin ess affor ded man y of them the oppor tun ity to e n ter the brick-an d- mor tar busin ess on ce the econ om y impr ove d, just as Raul Martin ez did decades pr eviou sly.3 9 Iron ically, the econ om ic for ces of the Great Recession also s aw the reverse of this tren d: brick-an d-mor tar restauran ts expa n din g in to t he food t ruck market as a way of augmen tin g weak sales an d reachin g n ew loc ation s withou t heavy in frastructure cos ts. Mun icipa l or din an ces gove rn in g food t rucks are less on erou s than thos e gove rn in g brick-an d-mor tar restauran ts, yet food t rucks still face regulator y burden s. Regulation s were used either to t ry to e limin ate com pe tition for brick-an d-mor tar restauran ts or , in con tempor ary times, as a matter of pu blic health an d hygien e. Som e of these regulation s are n ecessary, but ot hers are remn an ts of a fast-disappe arin g era. For in stan ce, in Chicago f ood t rucks are n ot allow ed to pa rk within 200 f eet of a restauran t or stay for mor e than 2 h ou rs at a pa rticular loc ation .4 0 Toda y, there are food t ruck assoc iation s arou n d the cou n try actively wor kin g to r epe al such ou t-of -date laws, which were design ed to m ake ven din g difficult. This exampl e on ce again un der-scor es the ten sion that rises when gove rn men t regulation s struggle to k eep pa ce with chan gin g tren ds an d cultural pr eferen ces. Food t rucks have lon g been a cheap a n d easy altern ative for thos e look in g for food: ice cream trucks caterin g to c hildren who c an ’t drive an d n ight ow ls caterin g to t he midn ight crow d when all ot her opt ion s go da rk. But beyon d these basic n eeds, it is their ability to c reate soc ial activity an d attract pe opl e to on e loc ation that make them a reliable tactic for activatin g ot herwise mor ibun d urban spa ces. From the time of the chuckwagon to t oda y, pe opl e wan t to be in spa ces where there are ot her pe opl e. When pu blic spa ces fail because they lack the n ecessary framewor k to f acilitate human activity, food t rucks of ten pr ovi de just the spa rk n eeded to br in g them back to l ife, if on ly for a few hou rs a day.4 1 Seaside, Flo rida: a Tactical (New) Urban ism From citizen s buildin g an d main tain in g the first urban street to t he triumph of les bouqui ni s tes , low -cos t, mobi le, tempor ary, an d even un san ction ed respon ses to t he issues of the day have the pot en tial to be widely adopt ed an d highly in fluen tial, at the macro or micro s cale. As ou r fin al exampl e show s, when bot h the framewor k an d rituals com e tog ether, great pl aces can be made. First tested in the rural scrub pi n elan d of the Flor ida pa n han dle, the New Urban ism was critical of mode rn ist pl an n in g theor y an d pr actice an d was able to t ran slate its pr in cipl es in to a viable altern ative to t he top- dow n coc ktail of federal, state, an d loc al regulation s that man dated a suburban spr awl lifestyle (mor e on this in chapt er 3 ). Its theor ies an d pr actice of com pa ct, walkable urban ism were first tested in the coa stal com mun ity of Seaside in the early 1980s , in much the same way that the White City tested City Beautiful theor ies n early a cen tury earlier. The 80- acre com mun ity was in cubated with tempor ary structures an d pr og rammin g demon stratin g New Urban ist pr in cipl es. In deed, tow n fou n ders Robe rt an d Daryl Davis shun n ed mode rn pr actices by appr oa chin g the developm en t of Seaside in a slow , ph ased way that n ot on ly was con sisten t with a beach lifestyle but exempl ifies how develope rs can use Tactical Urban ism to s eed lon g-term developm en t, even in a very remot e loc ation . As Robe rt Davis wou ld say, “Seaside wou ld thus grow slow ly, on e street at a time.” Althou gh the Davises had a great con cept ual pl an for their ideal tow n , the pa ce of developm en t en sured that they cou ld test ou t the market befor e takin g the master pl an beyon d the con cept ual stage. They in itially built a beach pa vilion an d two h ou ses; bot h were used as sales mode ls, an d on e was also t heir hou se. “It was Daryl’s advice, in 1981, t o s top t ryin g to de sign the pe rfect vern acular beach cot tage for Nor thwest Flor ida an d build on e or two t hat seemed pr etty good. J ust as on e ‘pr acticed’ architecture, on e cou ld ‘pr actice’ developm en t, refin in g an d impr ovi n g ove r time.” On ce again , the use of an iterative pr oc ess is at the heart of Tactical Urban ism: build, measure, learn , repe at. An un derused vacan t lo t in Bro o klyn ’s DUMBO n eighbo rho o d. (Mike Lydo n ) Begin n in g in 2 0 1 3 , the same vacan t lo t was en liven ed five times a week by fo o d trucks. (Mike Lydo n ) Seaside Saturday Market, ca. 1 9 8 2 . (Image co urtesy o f the Seaside Archives an d the Seaside Research Po rtal at the Un iversity o f No tre Dame, seaside.library.n d.edu) In a similar way, the Davises also r elied on pr og rammin g within their buddin g com mun ity to c atalyze in terest an d attract pe opl e to t he com mun ity. Daryl wou ld set up a pr oj ector for impr om pt u movi e n ights in the tow n squ are. Seaside’s com mercial cor e started as an ope n air market un der can vas ten ts where pe opl e sol d fruits an d vegetables, han dcrafts, an d flea market items lon g befor e an y pe rman en t structures were built, in a man n er similar to t he markets that for med the com mercial begin n in gs of Lon don , Philadelph ia, or ot her tempor ary settlemen ts men tion ed earlier. Daryl Davis later said, “Our Saturday Market turn ed in to s tor es an d restauran ts an d ou r even ts became major attraction s. An d it all began with som e in gen uity, the dream of a better way of life, an d a little veggie stan d. I can ’t say we pl an n ed for this to h appe n , an d I can ’t say that we didn ’t. We bot h were very in terested in creatin g activities in Seaside an d from thos e first attempt s at com mun ity buildin g ou r retail en terpr ise slow ly began an d flou rished.”4 2 Seaside is a classic exampl e of New Urban ism, yet it used Tactical Urban ism in its in fan cy. Whereas New Urban ism foc uses largely on the in tersection of pol icy an d ph ysical for m as a n ecessary pr og en itor of a healthier econ om y, en viron men t, an d popu lace, Tactical Urban ism adds the elemen ts of pr og ram an d ritual in to t he use an d adapt ation of n ew an d existin g ph ysical spa ces.4 3 The revelation is that simpl y defin in g an d design in g beautiful pu blic spa ce is n ot en ou gh. Ritual an d use have to be further in stigated; withou t the pr og rammin g an d activities—the r itual s of dai ly l ife—that take pl ace in pu blic spa ce there can be n o u rban life. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Fo o tn o tes Lewis Mumfo rd, The City in His to r y: Its Or igin s , Its Tr a n s fo r ma tio n s , a n d Its Pr o s p ects (New Yo rk: Marin er Bo o ks, 1 9 6 8 ), 5 . “The first true street o f which we have a reco rd may be in Khiro kitia, a hillto p settlemen t o f the sixth millen n ium BC in so uthern Cyp rus.… By exp licitly defin in g an d articulatin g an o utdo o r sp ace fo r the co mmo n go o d, the p eo p le assume a do uble resp o n sibility: the up keep o f this sp ace an d its p reservatio n as p ublic p ro p erty.

Taken tog ether they expos e the n eed for cities to n ot just refor m how they wor k but to c han ge the kin d of wor k they are set up t o pe rfor m. The cities that have begun to r espon d to these n eeds are already ou t ahead an d have begun to de fin e the evol ution of the Next American City. A Ren ewed Lo ve Affair with the City Cities are as cen tral to h uman civilization as they’ve ever been , an d in creasin gly mor e so. O n e hun dred years ago, 2 ou t of every 10 pe opl e arou n d the wor ld lived in an urban area. By 2010, m or e than half of us lived in urban areas, an d it’s pr edicted that by 2050 this pr opor tion will in crease to 7 ou t of 10. 1 As impr essive as these n umbers are, they don ’t tell the en tire stor y because the shift to l ivin g in cities has been accom pa n ied by an expon en tial grow th in the globa l popu lation . Bot h the scale an d the spe ed of globa l urban ization have created an urgen t n eed to de liver fast, low -cos t, an d high-impa ct urban impr ove men ts, pa rticularly in con texts where resou rces are pe rpe tually strain ed. Fo ur co n vergin g tren ds an d even ts have help ed in crease the use o f Tactical Urban ism in terven tio n s. Mor e than fou r ou t of five American s live in metropol itan region s, a term that broa dly defin es the exurbs, suburbs, an d the dow n tow n s they rely on . Our cor e cities are surrou n ded by rin gs of suburbs, som e with their ow n com mercial n ode s an d dow n tow n s of varyin g vin tage. Som e of these are in ten tion ally becom in g mor e like the cor e city each year: den se, walkable, an d tran sit-served. Others have little to n o i n terest in developi n g these urban characteristics an d may be viewed as stalwarts of an era when the con dition s of the city were n ot look ed at favor ably. Toda y, foot -, bike-, an d tran sit-frien dly com mun ities are drawin g in two m ajor demog raph ic coh or ts: the Millen n ial gen eration (thos e rou ghly between the ages of 18 an d 35) , of ten referred to a s Gen eration Y, an d, to a lesser exten t, thos e bor n in the pos t–Wor ld War II era, com mon ly referred to a s the Baby Boom ers. Bot h are con vergin g on pl aces that of fer com mercial, cultural, an d recreation al amen ities that are accessible in a variety of ways. This is a big deal. Eighty million Millen n ials—the largest gen eration al coh or t in American histor y—desirin g a differen t type of livin g arran gemen t are havin g a big impa ct on the spa tial layou t of ou r cities. Millen n ials marry an d start families much later than pr eviou s gen eration s, pe rfor m mor e freelan ce wor k, start their ow n busin esses at higher rates, an d are gen erally attracted to u rban en viron men ts where car- free or “car-lite” lifestyles are pos sible. A 2012 a rticle in The A tlant ic expl or ed these tren ds further, n ot in g, “Sin ce Wor ld War II, n ew cars an d suburban hou ses have pow ered the econ om y an d pr ope lled recove ries. Millen n ials may have los t in terest in bot h.”2 Bro o klyn Lo ve. (Mike Lydo n ) These you n g adults are movi n g to c ities where tran spor tation opt ion s are pl en tiful an d are less likely to g et a driver’s licen se than pr eviou s gen eration s by n early 30 pe rcen t, a tren d mirror ed by data on car ow n ership, w hich has droppe d by on e third for the 18- to 32- year-ol d demog raph ic sin ce 1980. These tren ds are havin g a n ot iceable impa ct on ou r drivin g habits. An on goi n g Un iversity of Michigan study titled “Has Mot or ization in the U.S. Peaked?” reveals that it’s n ot just Millen n ials who a re less in terested in drivin g. The study show s that pe r capi ta drivin g actually pe aked in 2004, y ears befor e the Great Recession . This study an d ot hers like it assert that althou gh it’s a little early to t ell, a sustain ed reduction in vehicle miles traveled, car pu rchases, an d gasol in e con sumpt ion may be here to s tay.3 Early eviden ce suggests that an ove rwhelmin g n umber of these you n g adults will pr efer stayin g in walkable urban loc ation s or at least move to ol der walkable suburbs rather than areas where hou sin g is cheape r but gettin g arou n d is mor e expe n sive (on e- qu arter of a typi cal suburban family’s budget n ow goe s to t ran spor tation ).4 These shifts are excitin g in man y ways, but they con tin ue to e xpos e discon n ects between the cities we have an d the kin d of cities we wan t. In deed, man y American cities are wor kin g un der ph ilos oph ical appr oa ches, regulator y structures, pu blic in vol vemen t pr oc esses, an d in frastructure pr og rams that were established in respon se to the demog raph ic, econ om ic, an d soc ioc ultural tren ds of an ot her era. Mor e spe cifically, ou r city’s zon in g code s an d lan d use or din an ces still skew tow ard low -den sity pa ttern s of grow th favor in g a sin gle mode of tran spor tation : the autom obi le. Doz en s of book s, studies, an d pl an s rou tin ely poi n t to bi llion s of dol lars spe n t un der the variou s Federal Highway an d Tran spor tation Acts, datin g back as far as the Roos evelt era, as a major factor pr odu cin g suburban spr awl. That may be true, but the top- dow n , citizen less appr oa ch to bu ildin g the In terstate system throu gh healthy, fun ction al urban n eighbor hoods was far mor e damagin g to t he American city than an y spr awl subsidy. Of cou rse, helpf ul regulator y pa tches an d tool s have been created ove r the years: zon in g ove rlay districts, pe rfor man ce zon in g, pl an n ed un it developm en ts, an d for m- based code s at the loc al level an d the lan dmark In termoda l Surface Tran spor tation Efficien cy Act an d HOPE VI at the federal level. These call for impr ove men ts to t he status qu o y et are too of ten grafted on to a brok en an d in creasin gly ban krupt system, on e that is n ot design ed for toda y’s challen ges an d oppor tun ities, let alon e thos e we’ll face in the future. With an on goi n g an d still urgen t n eed to u pda te the pr oj ect delivery system, we won der who’ s up f or the challen ge. The Millen n ial an d car-free mayo r Svan te Myrick (sp o rtin g the tie) walks to wo rk, so he tran sfo rmed his p rime Ithaca City Hall p arkin g sp ace in to a p arklet an d edited the sign to read, “Reserved fo r Mayo r … An d Frien ds.” (Svan te Myrick/Facebo o k) Cities that con tin ue on this pa th will fin d it tou gh to c om pe te region ally, n ation ally, an d even in tern ation ally. An d with 80 pe rcen t of American s n ow livin g in urban ized areas, ove rcom in g this challen ge—on e that is seemin gly hidden in pl ain sight—will requ ire a differen t appr oa ch to bu ildin g an d regulatin g the American city.5 For man y the arrival of the New Urban ism in the 1980s was a beacon of pr og ressive pl an n in g. New Urban ism was started by a small grou p of architects who saw the tradition al pa ttern of com pa ct, walkable urban ism as a sol ution to t he effects of suburban spr awl on the American city. By 1996, t he articulation of twen ty-seven cor e pr in cipl es—from the scale of the buildin g to t hat of the region —eschewed the results of the suburban expe rimen t an d pr oj ected a clear altern ative: walkable urban ity. So com pe llin g was the vision that in 1996 New Yor k Times architectural critic Herbert Muschamp c alled New Urban ism “the mos t impor tan t ph en om en on to e merge in American architecture in the pos t–Col d War era.”6 Man y urban highways rip p ed thro ugh fun ctio n in g n eighbo rho o ds when co n structed. Pictured here is the in terchan ge o f Arro yo Seco Parkway an d Highway 1 0 1 , in Lo s An geles Co un ty, CA. (Public do main . Accessed via Wikimedia Co mmo n s) New Urban ism repu diated the ahistor ical character of mode rn ism an d derided its pe rspe ctive that cities were som ethin g to be viewed an d expe rien ced from a car or pl an e an d that buildin gs were sepa rate obj ects n eedin g very little relation ship t o t heir cultural an d ph ysical surrou n din gs. The early victor y of the New Urban ism was in shiftin g the academic an d pr of ession al con versation away from mass suburban ization as the on ly available mode l for the human habitat. Mor e than 25 y ears later, schol ar, real estate develope r, an d author Christoph er Lein berger’s in fluen tial book The Opt ion of Ur bani s m foc used on the curren t an d grow in g deman d for mor e urban livin g, the kin d in lin e with the New Urban ism an d Smart Grow th advoc acy move men ts. The argumen t made by Lein berger an d so m an y ot hers is that suburban spr awl mor e than an y ot her pa ttern of developm en t is heavily subsidized by the American taxpa yer an d is a fin an cial mode l that, despi te its affor dable appe aran ces, will con tin ue to s train us, from the scale of the in dividual hou sehol d to that of the federal gove rn men t. Hol din g these issues up t o t he light is urban ist an d refor m-min ded pr ovoc ateur Charles Maroh n , who r efers to t he suburban developm en t pr oc ess as a Pon zi scheme, an expe rimen t that can be sustain ed on ly by the con stan t grow th of still mor e suburbia. Despi te the huge advan cemen ts made by the New Urban ist an d Smart Grow th move men ts an d their man y allies, the mos t recen t n ation al real estate boom , which culmin ated in the Great Recession of 2007, r eflected the same ol d low -den sity pa ttern of developm en t. In these con texts Tactical Urban ism will pl ay an in creasin gly impor tan t rol e throu gh the type of mobi le an d tempor ary services an d amen ities we describe throu ghou t this book . Toda y we are con fron ted with the legacy of the suburban mode l an d the helpf ul tool s to m ake urban an d suburban areas mor e livable an d sustain able, in cludin g Smart Grow th, Leadership i n En ergy an d En viron men tal Design for Neighbor hood Developm en t, New Urban ism, low -impa ct developm en t, smart code s, an d spr awl repa ir. Of cou rse, n ot all suburbs are created equ al, an d these tool s are by n o m ean s com pr ehen sive. On e tren d is appa ren t: The suburbs of tom or row will be differen t from toda y’s, for n o ot her reason than the kids who g rew up t here in the 1980s an d 1990s are a lot less in terested in return in g. As in terestin g as the on goi n g shift in suburban an d urban demog raph ics is, it is pe rhaps mor e remarkable that it’s oc currin g despi te the vast n umber of gove rn men t pol icies that make this shift mor e difficult than it n eeds to be . The grow in g mismatch between ou tdated gove rn men t pol icy an d the deman d for in frastructure an d urban amen ities is a big driver for the rise of Tactical Urban ism. It cou ldn ’t have been timed better because, as we’ll discuss in the n ext section , the Great Recession for ced almos t everyon e to do m or e with less. The Great Recessio n an d the New Eco n o my The n ew cen tury brou ght a level of wealth an d pr os pe rity to t he rich in the Un ited States that had n ever been seen befor e. For the rest it was merely an illusion . The spe ctacular burst of the 2007 r eal estate bubble an d the subsequ en t Great Recession reduced the average American family’s wealth to l evels n ot seen sin ce 1989. 7 The idea of in exhaustible grow th an d an ever-in creasin g tax base to f un d n ew pu blic facilities an d in frastructure qu ickly wen t by the wayside. It also r evealed that walkable, higher- den sity pl aces were pr eferable to t heir auto- cen tric, low -den sity cou n terpa rts. In the wor ds of Ton y Schwartz, the “‘mor e, bigger, faster’ ethos of the market econ om ies sin ce the In dustrial Revol ution , is grou n ded in a mythical an d misguided assumpt ion —that ou r resou rces are in fin ite.”8 On e n eed on ly com pa re state an d loc al gove rn men t budgets an d services befor e an d after the Great Recession to s ee how misguided the pr evailin g pa radigm has been . In the first decade of the twen ty-first cen tury, mun icipa l expe n ditures grew by $100 m illion a year un til the start of the recession in 2007. T his surge in expe n ditures was due in n o s mall pa rt to t he rapi d expa n sion of mun icipa l services n ecessitated by suburban spr awl. Accor din g to T om my Pacello, a pr oj ect man ager with the mayor ’s In n ova tion Delivery Team in Memph is, Ten n essee, between 1970 a n d 2010 h is city’s lan d area grew 55 pe rcen t while the popu lation in creased on ly 4 pe rcen t. We’re n ot econ om ists, but this is n ot an econ om ically sustain able appr oa ch for an y metropol itan region . Hom e pr ices in walkable areas held mor e value durin g the Great Recession than their auto- cen tric cou n terpa rts an d saw a faster in crease in value ove r suburban areas in 2012. 9 In her 2013 book The End of the Subur bs , Leigh Gallagher show s that real estate values are n ow risin g rapi dly in pl aces where drivin g is n ot the on ly way to g et arou n d. Gallagher expl ain s that from Seattle to C ol umbus, Den ver to N ew Yor k, the valuation of pr ope rty in cor e urban n eighbor hoods has in creased dramatically as hou sin g pr eferen ces con tin ue to s hift tow ard com pa ct, walkable n eighbor hoods . Places such as Seattle’s Capi tol Hill an d Col umbus’s Shor t Nor th n eighbor hood, w hich for decades were pr iced low er than n ewer, frin ge developm en ts, n ow exceed their suburban cou n terpa rts, a tren d that seems to be acceleratin g.1 0 In deed, in the 12- mon th pe riod be tween 2010 a n d 201 1, h ou sin g grow th in the cor e of mos t Nor th American cities exceeded that of its suburbs for the first time sin ce the 1920s .1 1 Smart develope rs are takin g n ot e, as for merly large-scale suburban builders such as Tol l Brot hers ope n urban developm en t pr actices, which in som e markets have becom e their mos t robu st. So what expl ain s this sudden in version ? The an swer lies pa rtially in the dimin ishin g econ om ic ration ality of seekin g cheap hom es built on cheap l an d at the suburban frin ge. This “drive un til you qu alify” men tality wor ked to a poi n t for man y American s, but it n o l on ger makes sen se as tran spor tation cos ts of ten match or even exceed hou sin g cos ts. Provi n g this poi n t is a 2012 j oi n t repor t issued by the Cen ter for Neighbor hood T echn ol og y an d the Cen ter for Hou sin g Pol icy that fou n d hou sin g an d tran spor tation cos ts ros e 1.75 pe rcen t faster than in com e in the 2000s , which further strain ed already stretched budgets. The fin din gs held true for each of the twen ty-five largest US metropol itan areas, althou gh the dispa rity was greater in som e areas than ot hers. Outlyin g suburbs were hit harder than urban cen ters durin g the Great Recessio n . (Co p yright Alex S. MacLean / Lan dslides Aerial Pho to grap hy) Alan Berube an d Elizabeth Kn eebon e, bot h Brook in gs In stitute fellow s an d coa uthor s of Conf r ont ing Subur ban P ov er ty in A mer ica , have fou n d that American pove rty, lon g assoc iated with highly rural an d urban areas, has shifted to t he suburbs.1 2 Cen sus data col lected between 2000 a n d 201 1 s how that the n umber of pe opl e livin g below the pove rty lin e in cities in creased by 29 pe rcen t while in the suburbs it in creased by 64 pe rcen t.

This is a pos itive econ om ic reversal for man y American cities’ tax rol ls, but it also por ten ds a variety of n ew challen ges for metropol itan region s as a whol e. The move men t of pe opl e with fewer resou rces to h ou sin g beyon d city cen ters mean s that empl oy men t oppor tun ities, soc ial services, an d low -cos t tran spor tation opt ion s are less accessible an d may further in crease the widen in g gap be tween rich an d poor .

Addressin g the affor dable hou sin g crisis in ou r mos t desirable metropol itan areas, such as New Yor k or San Fran cisco, w ill requ ire a region al appr oa ch to h ou sin g, the kin d that seems very difficult to a chieve. Regardless of why values held steady or ros e in urban pl aces, hou sin g an d tran spor tation tog ether con sumed an average of 48 pe rcen t of the median hou sehol d’s in com e by decade’s en d.1 4 It is for this reason an d ot hers that Millen n ials an d ot her grou ps are opt in g ou t of the 40- min ute com mute an d choos in g n eighbor hoods that of fer n ot on ly low -cos t tran spor tation opt ion s, such as bikin g an d takin g the bus, but lan d use pa ttern s that pu t mor e amen ities within walkin g distan ce. This con cept is what the Cen ter for Neighbor hood T echn ol og y calls tot al af for dabi lity, an d it almos t always favor s urban areas, despi te the higher hom e pr ices. If movi n g to a walkable n eighbor hood h elps hou sehol ds achieve tot al affor dability, what’s the an swer for cities? Sin ce the on set of the Great Recession , mun icipa l budgets have stagn ated (or dwin dled) while the deman d for services, resou rces, in frastructure, an d tran spor tation has grow n . As a result, loc al gove rn men ts have been for ced to r ethin k the con ven tion al budget pr oc ess an d in man y cases to i mpl emen t a variety of cos t-savin g measures in cludin g hirin g an d pa y freezes, pa y cuts, layof fs, furlou ghs, early retiremen t in cen tives, an d buyou ts. This dow n shift strain ed staff resou rces, which led to de layed or can celed pr oj ects an d cuts to m un icipa l services an d in frastructure repa irs.1 5 Yet just because tax reven ues are n ot grow in g doe s n ot decrease the pr essure on city gove rn men ts to pr odu ce better results, an d mor e cheapl y; in fact, it in creases thos e pr essures. Durin g times of econ om ic recession , state an d mun icipa l gove rn men ts are mor e heavily relied on as pr ovi ders of soc ial safety n et services.1 6 The con fluen ce of these factor s made con dition s ripe for the rise of Tactical Urban ism, at least as it appl ied to n eighbor hood- scale pr oj ects where citizen s took matters in to t heir ow n han ds an d gove rn men ts were for ced to a djust their activities with low er-cos t an d mor e n imble pr oj ect delivery methods . In the wor ds of researchers Karen Thor eson an d James H.

As on e of the early obs ervers (an d pa rticipa n ts) of the move men t, Robe rt Stallman says com pu ter hackers “typi cally had little respe ct for the silly rules that admin istrator s like to i mpos e, so t hey look ed for ways arou n d.”1 8 Toda y, hackin g is n ot abou t an en d goa l but abou t the way in which som ethin g is accom pl ished; it’s abou t fin din g ways arou n d con ven tion al rules to g et to a n en d result, of ten throu gh an ope n sou rce an d a largely decen tralized structure or method. W e cou ld n ot fin d a better descript ion for the do- it-you rself spi rit of Tactical Urban ism. Tactical Urban ism is a way for citizen s and mun icipa lities to h ack the city. As we described in chapt er 2 , the idea of hackin g as it relates to c ity pl an n in g has been stewin g for decades an d is fou n d in the wor k of pi on eers such as Bon n ie Ora Sherk in San Fran cisco i n the 1970s . For us, the con n ection between these ideas an d the term Tac tical Ur bani s m was first made in a pos t by lan dscape architect Brian Davis on the fas lany c blog , describin g New Yor k City’s “Green light for Broa dway” pr oj ect. Davis referred to t he qu ick chan ges pr ovi ded alon g Broa dway as “in expe n sive hacks, tactical in terven tion s pr odu cin g great effects.”1 9 This descript ion crystalized the idea that Tactical Urban ism ow ed a large pa rt of its in spi ration to h ackin g culture an d the greater in filtration of digital techn ol og y in mode rn life. In his book The End of B ig: How the Int er ne t Mak es Dav id the New Gol iat h, Nicco M ele expl ain s the impa ct, bot h pos itive an d n egative, that digital tool s are havin g on som e of ou r largest cultural in stitution s. He terms the widespr ead adopt ion of han dheld digital techn ol og y an d access to t he In tern et “radical con n ectivity.” Accor din g to M ele, Big Gove rn men t, Big Education , an d Big Jou rn alism have all been disrupt ed an d for ever altered by the democ ratizin g effect of access to i n for mation n etwor ks. An d than ks to a wide array of sof tware, hardware, an d web-based appl ication s, pe opl e n o lon ger n eed to r ely on these on ce ven erable in stitution s. The En d of Big thesis is highly relevan t to t he shift we see oc currin g in the field of urban pl an n in g, on e where demog raph ic shifts, such as the Great In version , are com bin in g with radical con n ectivity to a lter the efficacy an d rol e of on e of Big Gove rn men t’s cen tral fun ction s: Big Plan n in g. “Radical con n ectivity is abou t a tran sfer of pow er from in stitution s to i n dividuals. If you asked som eon e in the early 70s what a com pu ter was, what came to m in d was a device that cou ld fill a big room or of fice. Toda y 130 m illion American s carry arou n d smartph on es with the same or greater com pu tin g pow er than a com pu ter from 1974 had,” said Mele.2 0 The En d of Big thesis is highly relevan t to t he shift we see oc currin g in the field of urban pl an n in g, on e where demog raph ic shifts, such as the Great In version , are com bin in g with radical con n ectivity to a lter the efficacy an d rol e of on e of Big Gove rn men t’s cen tral fun ction s: Big Plan n in g. The same chan ges happe n in g to B ig Gove rn men t have also be en happe n in g slow ly in the wor kpl ace. In a 2012 s urvey by the empl oy men t n on -pr of it Catalyst, 80 pe rcen t of empl oy ees con firmed that their com pa n ies had flexible wor kin g arran gemen ts that in cluded telecom mutin g an d wor kin g fewer hou rs pe r week.2 1 Almos t 37 pe rcen t of Millen n ials pr efer a flexible schedule ove r a fixed on e. Con siderin g the com in g labor imbalan ce as mor e Baby Boom ers retire, it’s n ot hard to s ee how the Millen n ials (30 pe rcen t of the wor kfor ce toda y, 60 pe rcen t in 2050) will set the tren d.2 2 Althou gh the con ven tion al of fice buildin g has value, techn ol og y has allow ed pe opl e to w or k from an ywhere, makin g the city at large a usable of fice spa ce. The break from cor por ate of fice pa rks an d the con ven tion al 9- to- 5 m ode l has driven the deman d for urban livin g higher because thos e loc ation s are the on es with the best existin g in frastructure for a flexible schedule (easy access to t he In tern et an d amen ities). In man y ways, this is really just an exten sion of Richard Flor ida’s “street-level culture,” which teems with a “blen d of cafes, sidewalk musician s, an d small galleries an d bistros , where it is hard to dr aw the lin e between pa rticipa n t an d obs erver, or between creativity an d its creator s.”2 3 Urban ization alon g with the decen tralization of the wor kpl ace has pl aced pe opl e back in the sph ere of street-level culture an d in so doi n g has created a feedback mechan ism that will con tin ue to f uel the in terest in urban livin g. The adven t of the In tern et, pe rson al com pu tin g, an d mobi le devices an d the expon en tial grow th in com pu tin g pow er ove r the pa st 30 y ears have shape d ou r expe ctation s with regard to t he exchan ge of in for mation , wor k, soc ial relation ships , an d gove rn men t. A whol e gen eration of American s has grow n up w ith the dom in atin g pr esen ce of the com pu ter in their lives. These so- called digital n atives (pe opl e bor n after 1980) n ow accou n t for 47 pe rcen t of the tot al US popu lation accor din g to 201 1 cen sus data, a n umber that will on ly get bigger with time. Man y argue that the Great Recession simpl y hasten ed a tren d that was already well on its way befor e 2007. T hin kers such as Ray Kurzweil an d Everett Rog ers have been makin g pr ediction s for years abou t how bot h ideas an d techn ol og y develop a n d their impa ct on the econ om y. Kurzweil has been at the for efron t of pr edictin g how the ever- decreasin g pr ice of techn ol og y will have pr of ou n d effects on all facets of civilization ; this tren d is man ifestin g itself in the econ om y by creatin g efficien cies in systems an d pr oj ect delivery pr oc esses an d by brin gin g cos ts dow n so l ow “that man y goods an d services are becom in g n early free, abun dan t, an d n o l on ger subject to m arket for ces.”2 4 The un pr eceden ted availability of in for mation an d qu ick com mun ication has created an expe ctation that chan ge will oc cur qu ickly. The expe ctation of man y digital n atives an d digital immigran ts has been established by the rhythmic, almos t season al chan ge in sof tware for a variety of sof tware pr og rams, apps , an d the devices on which they ope rate. Doe s an yon e remember Win dow s 3.0? Our expe ctation as con sumers of these pr odu cts is that with each n ew gen eration , som ethin g has been impr ove d, a n ew fun ction ality added, or an ol d defect aban don ed. There is an obvi ou s dow n side to t he excessive con sumerism that com es with the obs ol escen ce of techn ol og y, yet ou r culture has becom e mor e com for table with chan ge in an iterative but fairly rapi d fashion . This is the cultural legacy of Moor e’s law an d the expon en tial n ature of techn ol og ical in n ova tion . Tactical Urban ism is just on e cultural man ifestation of this idea in the city. It, too, i s iterative. If the pa st 50 y ears of techn ol og ical in n ova tion an d evol ution are an y in dication , the n ext 50 w ill be just as revol ution ary for the way we live an d wor k in cities. In the wor ds of com pu ter pr og rammer Eric Raymon d, The hacker culture an d its successes pos e by exampl e som e fun damen tal qu estion s abou t human mot ivation , the or gan ization of wor k, the future of pr of ession alism, an d the shape of the firm—an d abou t how all of these thin gs will chan ge an d evol ve in the in for mation -rich pos t-scarcity econ om ies of the 21s t cen tury an d beyon d.…This shou ld make what we kn ow abou t the hacker culture of in terest to an yon e else who w ill have to l ive an d wor k in the future.2 5 The impl ication s for urban ists the wor ld ove r is that radical con n ectivity actually thrives within the ph ysical framewor k of com pa ct urban ism because the city is on e of the mos t com pl ex an d basic human techn ol og ies. The marriage of the digital econ om y an d the tradition al city may com e as a surpr ise to t hos e who pr edicted the demise of urban culture at the han ds of the Wor ld Wide Web but n ot to l umin aries such as architecture critic Paul Gol dberger. In a pr escien t spe ech delivered in 2001 a t the Un iversity of Califor n ia–Berkeley, Gol dberger discussed “Cities, Place, an d Cyberspa ce”: An d for all that the tradition al city might appe ar to be an tithetical to t he way we live an d the way we build an d the way we thin k toda y, in a metaph or ical sen se it is absol utely of this mom en t, for I thin k of the city n ot as oppos ite to t he In tern et, but as absol utely like it. In a sen se, it is the or igin al In tern et, the or igin al hype rlin k— sin ce cities are pl aces in which ran dom con n ection s, rather than lin ear or der, of ten determin es what will happe n . Cities aren ’t lin ear, even thou gh they exist in real spa ce. Ran dom con n ection s are what make them wor k, an d surpr ise an d a sen se of in fin ite choi ce is what gives them their pow er. Maybe that is the mos t impor tan t reason of all that ol d-fashion ed cities aren ’t obs ol ete—because their very ph ysical for m is itself a series of hype rlin ks in real spa ce. Paradox ically it is the theme pa rk that is lin ear, an d the ol d city that repr esen ts the n ew way. The con vergen ce of the hardware of daily life an d the virtual n etwor k of the web is on e man ifestation of the ph en om en on of ten described as “the In tern et of thin gs.” Simpl y pu t, the In tern et of thin gs is the n etwor k that oc curs when obj ects exchan ge in for mation withou t human in pu t. This techn ol og y has helpe d en han ce urban livin g by in creasin g access to t he sharin g econ om y. A New Yor k Times article described the tren d this way: “This col labor ative rather than capi talistic appr oa ch is abou t shared access rather than pr ivate ow n ership.” 2 6 For exampl e, 1.7 m illion pe opl e globa lly are members of car-sharin g services, a busin ess that keeps grow in g an d wou ld n ot be pos sible if n ot for the ability of each car to c om mun icate its availability to pos sible users within a n etwor k. The impl ication s for urban ism are clear; a recen t survey fou n d that the n umber of vehicles ow n ed by car- sharin g pa rticipa n ts decreased by half after they joi n ed the service, with members pr eferrin g access in stead of the burden of ow n ership. W ithou t an y n ew tran sit or bike in frastructure, simpl y derivin g n ew efficien cies from the existin g system can drastically reduce the n umber of cars on city roa ds. Million s of pe opl e are usin g soc ial media sites, redistribution n etwor ks, ren tals, an d coope ratives to s hare n ot on ly cars but also h om es, clot hes, tool s, toy s, an d ot her items at low cos t or for free. The availability of wireless In tern et in frastructure has also helpe d establish a soc ial an d tech-based appr oa ch that con n ects the dot s between in for mation , a dispe rsed citizen ry, an d the gove rn men t. Accor din g to a 2009 s urvey con ducted by the Public Techn ol og y In stitute in Washin gton , DC, 75 pe rcen t of loc al gove rn men t respon den ts had adopt ed “RSS feeds to pr ovi de n ews an d upda tes from the gove rn men t websites to c itizen s; Twitter to pr ovi de emergen cy, pu blic safety, an d ot her alerts to t he pu blic an d media; an d Facebook to c om mun icate even ts an d a ran ge of ot her messages with the pu blic. In addition , almos t 60 pe rcen t of loc al gove rn men t respon den ts said they use You Tube (or similar services) for the pu rpos es of even t an d pr og ram pr om ot ion , an d to br oa den the audien ce of viewers beyon d the reach of pu blic access television chan n els.”2 7 To pu t this all in pe rspe ctive, the array of In tern et-based com mun ication tool s an d services we take for gran ted toda y didn ’t exist when we started ou r pl an n in g an d architecture careers less than a decade ago. T hus, the spe ed at which they’ve pe n etrated so m an y facets of ou r lives can n ot be ign or ed an d as much as an ythin g else is respon sible for the grow th of Tactical Urban ism. Althou gh n ew techn ol og y allow s gove rn men t to r espon d mor e qu ickly an d efficien tly, the use of basic techn ol og y in pl an n in g an d gove rn men t has emerged slow ly, espe cially as viewed by tech-savvy digital n atives who w an t to r espon d to c hallen ges bot h digitally an d ph ysically.2 8 Man y cities still don ’t have an y fun ction al pr oc esses on lin e, which mean s they might as well n ot exist at all for a grow in g n umber of con stituen ts. Of cou rse, there are also pe opl e who don ’t have or take advan tage of regular access to t he In tern et. This so- called digital divide brin gs up on goi n g equ ity con cern s an d qu estion s abou t access to basic goods an d services for thos e who l og on in frequ en tly, if at all. Althou gh hacker culture is abou t creatively reshapi n g ou r surrou n din gs an d shor t- circuitin g existin g systems, it is ultimately abou t disrupt in g existin g pr oc esses an d ways of accom pl ishin g goa ls. We hope that on e of the biggest casualties of the wider adopt ion of this hacker culture ph ilos oph y, espe cially throu gh the use of Tactical Urban ism, will be som e of the mor e on erou s aspe cts of Big Plan n in g. In deed, while man y call for larger or smaller gove rn men t, it seems mos t in the risin g Millen n ial gen eration stay mor e n eutral an d simpl y pr efer better gove rn men t.2 9 Propon en ts of what’s som etimes called “civic tech” are attempt in g to w or k bot h ou tside an d within gove rn men t to a ddress these challen ges usin g the latest digital techn ol og y. As Joh n Sot sky from the Kn ight Fou n dation has said, “The mor e pe opl e use techn ol og y as con sumers the mor e they expe ct techn ol og y to s hape their expe rien ce as citizen s.”3 0 An d than ks to t he rise of radical con n ectivity, the con vergen ce of civic n eeds an d techn ol og ical pos sibilities is fin ally takin g of f. What has becom e kn ow n as M-gove rn men t, or mobi le gove rn men t, can be seen in websites an d apps such as SeeClickFix, the Daily Pot hol e, Shareabou ts, or TurboV ot e —a riff on Turbo T ax—that makes it easy to r egister to vot e. Ioby , a “crow d- resou rcin g” pl atfor m for citizen -led n eighbor hood pr oj ects, has becom e a favor ite tool of Tactical Urban ists because it “gives everyon e the ability to or gan ize all kin ds of capi tal—cash, soc ial capi tal, in kin d don ation s, vol un teer time, advoc acy—from within the com mun ity to s erve the com mun ity.”3 1 Radical con n ectivity is n ot pu llin g us apa rt, as som e on ce pr edicted, but brin gin g us clos er tog ether, at least ph ysically. In deed, mobi le ph on es pl ayed a cen tral rol e in the un fol din g revol ution s, pr ot ests, an d pol itical chan ges in the wor ld, from the election of Barack Obama, to t he Occupy Wall Street move men t, to t he Arab Spr in g. Twitter, Facebook , an d text messages helpe d share the ph ot os an d videos that wen t viral durin g the recen t revol ution s in Egypt an d Libya, lettin g pe opl e kn ow abou t pr ot est loc ation s an d times—a con sequ en ce n ot on ly of the mobi le apps used for com mun ication but of the wide availability of low -cos t wireless devices. These techn ol og ies are fun damen tally shiftin g how pe opl e pa rticipa te an d or gan ize themselves, yet they are almos t always used in con jun ction within the tradition al framewor k of the city. As a result, the wor ld n ow kn ow s Cairo’ s Tahrir Squ are, Istan bul’s Taksim Squ are, an d New Yor k City’s Zuccot ti Park. The rise of the Tactical Urban ism move men t, thou gh n ot viol en t or established for ove rt pol itical reason s, also r elies on the dual in frastructure of the In tern et an d the ph ysical framewor k of the city so t hat tog ether we may all wor k to a ddress deficien cies in the relation ship be tween gove rn men t an d the pe opl e.3 2 The Challen ge o f Gettin g Thin gs Do n e As mor e pe opl e move to t he city or simpl y choos e to s tay there, they deman d mun icipa l amen ities that are n ot always available, an d the for mal pr oc esses that shou ld facilitate the chan ge they n eed are lackin g. This is as true in for mer in dustrial pr ecin cts or tradition ally un derserved areas as in an y pl ace expe rien cin g an in flux of n ew residen ts. As pe opl e try to i mpr ove their com mun ity, they of ten first appr oa ch their city cou n cilor , the loc al pl an n in g depa rtmen t, or even the mayor ’s of fice in an effor t to br in g an idea to fruition . Often it doe sn ’t take lon g for them to di scove r that the for mal pr oc ess that facilitates chan ge is of ten ou t of date, cumbersom e, an d far too t ime-con sumin g to m ake it wor th the effor t. This results in frustration as pe opl e feel they have little to n o a bility to l egally use the system, loc al or ot herwise, to e n act pos itive chan ge in their n eighbor hoods or beyon d. Accor din g to a 2013 P ew Research Cen ter an alysis, American trust in elected of ficials reached an all-time low in 2010, f rom an 80 pe rcen t high back in 1956. 3 3 The disen chan tmen t with the pol itical system an d its lack of respon siven ess tow ard the citizen ry goe s far beyon d the shor tcom in gs of the pu blic pl an n in g pr oc ess. The recen t atmos ph ere of cyn icism can be traced to a hos t of factor s that are beyon d the scope of this book , from war to ba ilou ts for big in dustry. The frustration created ripe con dition s for move men ts such as the Tea Party an d Occupy Wall Street, which com e from oppos ite en ds of the pol itical spe ctrum yet have mor e in com mon than mos t are willin g to a dmit. In gen eral there seems to be a feelin g that n o m atter the level, gove rn men t shou ld be mor e respon sive to t he everyday challen ges of the pe opl e it serves. When viewed in this way, Tactical Urban ism is as much abou t curren t tren ds affectin g city pl an n in g as it is abou t the relation ship—or respon siven ess—of a gove rn men t to i ts citizen ry. An d even thou gh the scarcity caused by the Great Recession pr om ot ed the adopt ion of Web 2.0 t echn ol og ies by mun icipa l gove rn men ts, there remain s a lin gerin g frustration with the for mal pr oc edures an d pr oc esses of ou r democ racy strugglin g to r espon d to pu blic deman d.3 4 The n ew pe opl e-foc used Times Squ are described in the pr eface of this book pr actically appe ared ove rn ight, but it was hardly a n ew idea.

Althou gh the idea had merit for reason s we’ll discuss in chapt er 4 , the pol itical com pl exity of pe rman en tly clos in g doz en s of bloc ks to c ars—an d the lackluster tool s pl an n ers had to de liver the pr oj ect again st immediate pu blic dissen t—wou ld deter even the bol dest pol itician s. An d it did. Yet the era in which the in itial Times Squ are pr opos al was made was on e of tran sition for the pl an n in g pr of ession .

An d althou gh this varies greatly from pl ace to pl ace an d pr oj ect to pr oj ect, the real challen ges facin g con tempor ary city dwellers toda y is that the pr oc ess doe s n ot serve their in terests an d or cultural expe ctation s.

This has pl ayed ou t rou tin ely acros s the cou n try ove r the decades.

Y et when it is discove red that impl emen tin g such pr oj ects takes mon ths of red tape , in suran ce, an d com mun ity con sen sus just to g et pe rmission , few have the ability to f ol low throu gh. The result, in som e cases, is that n or mally law-abidin g citizen s take action withou t pe rmission an d ask for for given ess later. It can be a pow erful method f or creatin g chan ge. Rom e certain ly wasn ’t built in a day, but we’re pr etty sure it cou ldn ’t be built at all toda y. Just ask Lou Catelli, a residen t of Baltimor e’s Hampde n n eighbor hood, w ho on e even in g used spr ay pa in t to f ashion a cros swalk at a busy fou r-way in tersection . After the city repa ved the street in 201 1, m ot or ists stoppe d n ot icin g the stop s ign s an d cros sin g pe destrian s because the city n ever return ed to r epa in t the cros swalks, stop bars, an d street cen terlin es. Residen ts an d busin esses in the n eighbor hood r epe atedly asked the city’s pu blic wor ks depa rtmen t to f in ish the job, bu t n o a ction was taken because the con tractor who r epa ved the street in sisted that col d weather wou ldn ’t allow them to c om pl ete the job. N ot satisfied with this an swer, Catelli took action himself. An d durin g his on e-n ight escapa de he repor ted that the Baltimor e pol ice pa ssed by the in tersection three sepa rate times while he was spr ay pa in tin g the cros swalks because of repor ts of “maliciou s pr ope rty destruction .” Seein g the civic n ature of Catelli’s so- called pr ope rty destruction effor ts, the pol ice of ficers took n o a ction to s top C atelli but repor tedly tol d him to f in ish the pr oj ect in stead. Lo u Catelli, a residen t o f Baltimo re’s Hamp den n eighbo rho o d, used sp ray p ain t to fashio n a cro sswalk at a busy fo ur- way in tersectio n when the City n ever return ed to do the jo b. (Debo rah Patterso n ) Soon thereafter, a spok espe rson for the Depa rtmen t of Tran spor tation respon ded to the “guerrilla cros swalk” by expl ain in g that residen ts are n ot allow ed to pa in t Baltimor e’s streets because of liability issues an d that they wou ld in vestigate if civil or crimin al action shou ld be taken again st Catelli’s effor ts. Baltimor e city cou n cilwom an Mary Pat Clarke, who r epr esen ts the area, took a differen t stan ce. She respon ded by sayin g that the city shou ld be than kin g pe opl e like Catelli because the visibility an d safety of pe opl e walkin g are a pr ior ity in the area, espe cially because of the surrou n din g school s. Catelli was n ever charged, an d the city return ed soon thereafter to com pl ete the stripi n g of the street.4 0 The time an d cos t requ ired for com pl etin g pr oj ects, from large in frastructure to small loc al impr ove men ts, is causin g citizen s an d mun icipa l admin istrator s to expe rien ce a kin d of apa thy called pl an n in g fatigue. Recove rin g from this type of civic en n ui is difficult, as even the mos t arden t n eighbor hood a ctivist or pol itical leader grow s tired of the seemin gly en dless pl an n in g pr oc ess.

To t his last poi n t, each of the stor ies in cluded in this chapt er ben efited tremen dou sly from the rise of r adi cal conne ctivity, which we described in chapt er 3 .

Althou gh Por tlan d’s except ion alism—real an d imagin ed —has requ ired stron g pol itical leadership, i t’s mor e accurately a reflection of a pr og ressive citiz en ry that has develope d a culture of civic in vol vemen t geared tow ard tran sfor min g the city. Perhaps n ot hin g reflects this better than the stor y of City Repa ir an d its sign ature pr oj ect: in tersection repa ir. City Repa ir is an appr oa ch to c om mun ity buildin g an d n eighbor hood pl acemakin g that uses pe rmaculture, n atural buildin g techn iqu es, an d pu blic art to i n stigate civic pa rticipa tion . These effor ts in clude in tersection repa ir, which reclaims a n eighbor hood in tersection to m ake it mor e attractive an d safe en ou gh to s erve as a pl ace for n eighbor s to g ather. In Por tlan d, it began with n eighbor s pa in tin g a large mural in an in tersection an d addin g a variety of pu blic amen ities such as ben ches, pu blic in for mation kios ks, an d a len din g library alon g the street edges. In tersection repa ir pr oj ects may in clude pr ivate pr ope rty as well as the pu blic rights-of -way.

When the City o f Po rtlan d determin ed that the T-Ho ws vio lated the city’s z o n in g laws, Mark Lakeman reassembled it o n a p ickup truck to create a mo bile teaho use, the T-Ho rse. (Pho to by Sarah Gilbert, cafemama.co m) Mo delin g a Differen t Future The City Repa ir stor y begin s in Por tlan d’s Sellwood n eighbor hood. L oc ated on the sou thern edge of the city, up on a Willamette River bluff, the n eighbor hood w as then , as it is n ow , full of mode st on e- an d two- stor y cot tages an d bun galow s. It was this n eighbor hood w here Mark Lakeman says he began to “ mode l a differen t future an d empow er ot hers to a chieve it.”4 Lakeman is the son of a two s oc ially min ded architects who t aught him the value of pl an n in g an d design . Lakeman recalls thin kin g that pl an n ers “were like supe r heroe s, en vision in g thin gs befor e they ever existed. It was pow erful stuff.”5 Althou gh he later realiz ed how pol itically charged—an d successful—his father’s dow n tow n pr oj ects were, he also l earn ed that everyday citiz en s did n ot pl ay a rol e in con ceivin g or buildin g them. Mor eove r, with their foc us on dow n tow n , they did n ot brin g n eeded amen ities to t he n eighbor hoods where mos t Por tlan ders live. After spe n din g several years livin g abroa d an d studyin g the ways ot her cultures arran ged their soc ial an d ph ysical livin g pa ttern s, Lakeman return ed hom e in 1995 on ly to e xpe rien ce culture shoc k. Fresh of f a stin t livin g an d wor kin g with Mayan s in the Mexican an d Guatemalan rain for est, he grew frustrated with how isol ated he an d his Por tlan d n eighbor s were from each ot her, despi te livin g in such clos e pr ox imity. Accor din g to L akeman , “I look ed arou n d an d wen t, ‘Nobody here has ever made the choi ce to z on e their life!’”6 In an effor t to br idge this gap h e con vin ced a few frien ds to h elp h im create a pl ace where pe opl e cou ld meet each ot her, share resou rces, an d gen erally build a stron ger sen se of com mun ity. Usin g n atural an d recycled materials cos tin g a mere $65, 7 Lakeman design ed a small com mun ity buildin g where pe opl e cou ld meet ove r tea. He called it the T-How s (pr on ou n ced “teahou se”). It was assembled in the backyard of a Sellwood hom e an d qu ickly became the site of weekly meetin gs an d pot lucks where n eighbor hood residen ts met an d shared in the amen ity of the n ew com mun ity spa ce. It became clear almos t in stan tly that Lakeman tappe d in to a n un met deman d for soc ial gatherin g spa ce. Yet the structure was built withou t a city pe rmit an d large en ou gh that it viol ated the city’s z on in g laws. After 6 m on ths of grow in g popu larity, city of ficials fin ally called for its remova l. Always a step a head, Lakeman had design ed the structure to be easily disman tled. He simpl y reattached the T-How s materials (recycled Plexiglas, wood, pl astic sheathin g, an d bamboo) to a n ol d Toy ot a pi ckup t ruck to c reate a mobi le teahou se, dubbed the T-Hor se. This mobi le version was design ed to de liver an in stan t com mun ity meetin g pl ace wherever it stoppe d. Accor din g to t he Soc ial En viron men tal Architects art exhibit blog , the T-Hor se “emerged to t ran scen d the remot e pow er of the city to de cide the destin y of com mun ities.”8 Dan iel Lerch, who n ow wor ks for the Pos t-Carbon In stitute, says that it was while atten din g an early gatherin g at the T-Hor se with abou t 200 ot hers that he realiz ed that urban sustain ability begin s n ot with light rail systems an d LEED buildin gs but with soc ial relation ships . Lakeman ’s T-Hor se, which cou ld be con sidered a mor e civic- min ded pr ecursor to t he rise of the food t ruck craz e, was an in ten tion ally low -cos t, mobi le, an d tactical way to a ctivate pu blic spa ce while also h elpi n g pe opl e build soc ial relation ships acros s the city. The T-Hor se brou ght the pow er of the T-How s to a much wider audien ce an d qu ickly became a ph ysical pl atfor m for an array of com mun ity discussion s abou t stren gthen in g the loc al econ om y, pl acemakin g, com mun ity empow ermen t, an d en viron men tal sustain ability. In discussin g the pow er of creative but simpl e in terven tion s like the T-Hor se, Lakeman states that pe opl e “start to s ee their whol e wor ld differen tly. It’s a pow erful impe tus for chan ge.”9 With the T-Hor se gallopi n g arou n d tow n , Lakeman move d to r een gage his Sellwood n eighbor s to r ecreate the magic of the or igin al T-How s. Accor din g to L akeman , the decision was to t ran sfor m on e in tersection in to a truly pu blic spa ce, on e that wou ld slow traffic an d allow n eighbor s to r ecreate the in tersection as a n eighbor hood s qu are. The small grou p c hos e the in tersection of Sou theast 9t h an d Sherrett Streets. As Lakeman said in an in terview, “the mom en tum that we’d built sudden ly leapt in to t he in tersection .”1 0 In tersectio n Rep air In the summer of 1996, t he grou p a ppr oa ched the Por tlan d Bureau of Tran spor tation (PBOT) with a pr opos al to pa in t the in tersection . Because there wasn ’t a pr eceden t for this in the City of Por tlan d or elsewhere, an d despi te their lobby in g effor ts, the grou p received n o s uppor t. In fact, on e PBOT of ficial in famou sly qu ippe d in a meetin g with the grou p, “ That’s pu blic spa ce—so n o on e can use it!”1 1 In spi red by the absurdity of the statemen t, the grou p of n eighbor s decided to m ove for ward a little mor e creatively. To s ubvert the city’s stubbor n n ess, Lakeman an d his n eighbor s decided to a ppl y for a stan dard bloc k pa rty pe rmit to c los e the streets en terin g the in tersection to c ars. How ever, rather than barbecue an d pl ay Frisbee in the street, the grou p m ove d for ward with a well-con sidered act of civil disobe dien ce by pa in tin g a large mural en com pa ssin g the en tire in tersection . They also bu ilt a 24- hou r self-serve tea station , a com mun ity bulletin boa rd, an in for mation kios k, an d a children ’s pl ayhou se, which still exist toda y. From that poi n t for ward, the in tersection of Sou theast 9t h an d Sherrett was kn ow n as “Share-It Squ are,” an d Por tlan d’s first in tersection repa ir was on view for the city to s ee. Not surpr isin gly, PBOT of ficials qu ickly threaten ed to h an d ou t fin es for alterin g city streets withou t their pe rmission .

(City Rep air) City cou n cil member Charlie Hales un derstood t he pr oj ect’s value an d was able to con vin ce the mayor , Vera Katz , an d her fellow city cou n cilor s that the n ewly dubbed Share-It Squ are shou ld n ot be dismissed for two r eason s.

With Hales’s suppor t an d 3 m on ths of mun icipa l effor t, the city cou n cil allow ed Share-It Squ are to s tay in pl ace. Mor eove r, the city began the slow pr oc ess of craftin g an or din an ce with simpl e criteria so t hat similar pr oj ects cou ld be un dertaken citywide. Almos t 15 y ears later Charlie Hales (who i s curren tly servin g as mayor ) tol d the Sightlin e In stitute abou t the ben efits assoc iated with in tersection repa ir: “It sou n ds whimsical, but then you go w alk arou n d [the in tersection ] on a Saturday aftern oon an d you get it. Neighbor s are talkin g, pe opl e drive slow er, an d you can tell you are in a pl ac e.”1 3 Over the n ext few years Share-It Squ are con tin ued to e vol ve: The 24- hou r tea station was rebuilt with pe rman en t materials (steel, wood, c on crete, an d mos aic tiles), the bulletin boa rd was expa n ded throu gh the addition of a Plexiglas roof an d chalkboa rds, a pr odu ce-sharin g station ope n ed, an d a sidewalk chalk dispe n ser appe ared.

T his mean t n eighbor hoods all ove r Por tlan d were able to l egally repl icate the pr oc ess, an d the 3- year-ol d, all- vol un teer City Repa ir or gan iz ation was ready an d willin g to h elp.

Beyon d in tersection repa ir, Earth Day, an d the Village Buildin g Con vergen ce, the City Repa ir or gan iz ation has also s pa wn ed several ot her Por tlan d pl acemakin g an d en viron men tal in itiatives. Dan iel Lerch says this is because City Repa ir “gives pe opl e pe rmission to do a ctivism.” Put differen tly, the pe opl e who g et in vol ved with City Repa ir learn the rope s of pl ace-based activism an d then shift their foc us to ot her spe cific areas of n eed.

But what happe n s when all these factor s are pr esen t in a n eighbor hood bu t mos t pe opl e livin g there do n ot usually walk? How can that culture be chan ged to e mbrace travel on two f eet? On a col d, rain y n ight in Jan uary 2012, a 29- year-ol d Nor th Carol in a State graduate studen t n amed Matt Tom asulo w en t look in g for an swers. In 2007 T om asulo m ove d to R aleigh to pu rsue a dual master’s degree in lan dscape architecture an d urban pl an n in g. What he fou n d was a fast-grow in g, highly suburban , auto- depe n den t city of 425,000 r esiden ts. Preferrin g a n eighbor hood w here drivin g is opt ion al, Tom asulo c hos e Cameron Village (Walkscor e: 80) because of its pr ox imity to campu s an d the daily n eeds that cou ld be reached on foot . His first expe rien ce with Tactical Urban ism was joi n in g fellow studen ts in Raleigh’s version of Park(in g) Day, an an n ual even t where citiz en s arou n d the wor ld pa y for a metered pa rkin g spa ce n ot to s tor e a car but to c reate a tempor ary, min iature pa rk. Thou gh fleetin g, the in terven tion helps pa ssersby con sider a mor e diverse use of their streets, the n eed for mor e pu blic spa ce, an d the n egative impa ct auto de pe n den cy has on soc iety—or at least thos e are the stated the goa ls. Yet Tom asulo f ou n d that his classmates’ version of Park(in g) Day did n ot have the desired impa ct because it was missin g on e key elemen t: pa ssersby. “I remember thin kin g that Park(in g) Day or even pa rklets don ’t serve much of a pu rpos e if so f ew pe opl e actually walk by or to t hem,” said Tom asulo. 2 9 Althou gh he was suppor tive of the in terven tion , his ow n expe rien ce with Park(in g) Day an d amblin g arou n d as a n ew residen t raised a n aggin g qu estion in his min d: Why do s o f ew pe opl e walk? After surveyin g frien ds, col leagues, n eighbor s, an d tot al stran gers, Tom asulo s ays he kept gettin g the same an swer: “It’s too f ar.” He didn ’t buy it. When we asked abou t the distan ces, the n or mally sof t-spok en Tom asulo r epl ied pa ssion ately, “It’s bullshit! At the time I chos e to l ive between the Un iversity an d dow n tow n , in a histor ic n eighbor hood bu ilt for walkin g, yet so f ew pe opl e wou ld. They wou ld drive two m in utes just to g et din n er.” So h e began mappi n g the popu lar destin ation s pe opl e listed when an swerin g qu estion s abou t where they were headed an d how they were goi n g to g et there. Was it really too f ar? He qu ickly discove red that a major ity of respon den ts were n o m or e than a 15- min ute walk from the destin ation s they n amed, with man y much clos er. That’s when he realiz ed: The actual distan ce wasn ’t the pr obl em, it was the pe r cept ion of that distan ce. Althou gh he kn ew he cou ldn ’t pe rman en tly chan ge lan d use, urban design , or in frastructure ove rn ight, he believed he cou ld tackle pe opl e’s mispe rcept ion of distan ce by pr ovi din g mor e in for mation . What if the city cou ld displ ay sign s with the n ames of popu lar loc al destin ation s, direction al arrow s in dicatin g where to w alk, an d the time it wou ld take the average pe rson to g et there? An d what if pe opl e cou ld scan a QR code on that sign to g et direction s in stan tly? After a little research, he discove red that the City of Raleigh had a n umber of pol icies in its com pr ehen sive pl an that en cou raged walkin g an d were whol ly con sisten t with Tom asulo’ s in ten t. How ever, he also l earn ed that wor kin g with the city wou ld be an expe n sive an d arduou s pr oc ess. In deed, accor din g to T om asulo, obt ain in g a tempor ary en croa chmen t pe rmit for his sign s cou ld have taken up t o 9 m on ths an d wou ld have cos t mor e than $1,000, i n cludin g the liability in suran ce cos ts. The time an d mon ey n eeded were two t hin gs Tom asulo di d n ot have. So h e began thin kin g throu gh how to i mpl emen t a wayfin din g pr oj ect in lin e with gove rn men t pol icy but carried ou t withou t gove rn men t pe rmission . After researchin g materials on lin e, he discove red n umerou s ways to de sign lightweight an d in expe n sive “guerrilla wayfin din g” sign s that wou ld cos t him abou t $300 dol lars to pr odu ce, or abou t on e fou rth the cos t of the san ction ed pr oc ess. He settled on the use of cor rugated, weather-resistan t Cor opl ast sign s that cou ld be attached to t eleph on e or street lamp pol es with z ip t ies. It didn ’t take lon g for Tom asulo t o de velop a pr ot ot ype on his lapt op. E ach sign wou ld in for m pe destrian s an d drivers of the time it wou ld take to walk to popu lar destin ation s. He had twen ty-seven sign s pr in ted an d, with the help of his girlfrien d (n ow wife) an d a frien d visitin g from Califor n ia, wen t ou t in the rain y Raleigh n ight to h an g them up. H e dubbed the pr oj ect “Walk Raleigh.” “I kn ew what I was doi n g,” says Tom asulo. “ I very in ten tion ally did n ot deface pu blic pr ope rty. I read up on ot her pr oj ects on lin e an d realiz ed that we shou ld avoi d adhesives; we n eeded som ethin g that cou ld be sn ippe d of f easily. This was n ot suppos ed to be maliciou s at all.” Poi n tin g to t he pr esen ce of equ ally illegal real estate sign s fou n d on lawn s an d teleph on e pol es acros s the city, Tom asulo s ays, “They of fer n o pu blic ben efit, yet of ten remain for mon ths on en d. Walk Raleigh at least had a civic pu rpos e an d was con sisten t with the city’s stated goa ls.” “I kn ew that the Com pr ehen sive Plan gave us som e justification , wayfin din g was already a desired elemen t in the city.”3 0 Tom asulo a lso k n ew that com mun icatin g the pr oj ect’s in ten t wou ld be impor tan t. “I kn ew the rol e the In tern et cou ld pl ay in expa n din g the reach of the pr oj ect.” Befor e pos tin g the sign s he bou ght the dom ain n ame walkraleigh.or g an d created a Walk Raleigh com mun ication pl atfor m via a Facebook pa ge an d a Twitter han dle. Tom asulo kn ew the QR code s cou ld help t rack the n umber of pe opl e in teractin g with the sign s. He also h ad the pr esen ce of min d to doc umen t the pr oj ect with well-com pos ed an d high- qu ality images, which have sin ce been beamed arou n d the wor ld an d grace the pa ges of this book . “We kn ew it wou ld help u s tell a stor y an d hope fully in spi re som e chan ge. Althou gh, I’ll be hon est, we didn ’t really kn ow what wou ld happe n n ext.” Within days the Facebook pa ge received hun dreds of “Likes,” an d the stor y began to make its way arou n d the urban ist blog os ph ere, which caught the atten tion of the A tlant ic Cities (n ow City Lab ) jou rn alist Emily Badger. She in cluded the pr oj ect, which she dubbed “Guerrilla Wayfin din g in Raleigh,” as the leadin g exampl e within a larger Tactical Urban ism pr oj ect rou n dup. S he n ot ed that “the stun t has actually caught the eye of city of ficials who m ay look to m ake the sign s pe rman en t. This is tactical urban ism at its best: a fly-by-n ight citiz en -led escapa de whos e whimsy cou ld ultimately pr om pt real impr ove men ts to c ity amen ities.”3 1 Of cou rse, we’ve sin ce learn ed that the “escapa de” was n ot a “stun t” but a well- thou ght-ou t an d carefully doc umen ted in terven tion in ten ded to i n spi re lon g-term behavior al chan ge in citiz en s an d ph ysical modi fication s from the city. Walk Raleigh was guerrilla. It was also do- it-you rself. But above all, it was tac tical . The article in the A tlant ic Cities brou ght in terest from ot her n ation al an d in tern ation al media ou tlets, in cludin g the BBC, which pr odu ced the stor y “How to G et America to W alk.” The stor y featured Mitchell Silver, who a t the time was servin g as the pr esiden t of the American Plan n in g Assoc iation an d Raleigh’s pl an n in g director . Tom asulo, w ho h ad n ever met Silver in pe rson , man aged to g et Silver in vol ved in the BBC stor y on ly after reachin g ou t to h im via a direct message on Twitter. Silver respon ded almos t immediately an d repor tedly rearran ged his travel schedule so t hat he’d be in tow n to m eet with the BBC (Silver later admitted that if Tom asulo h ad e- mailed him he n ever wou ld have received or respon ded to t he message in time). Silver’s pr esen ce in the stor y an d tacit appr ova l of Tom asulo’ s techn ically illegal act made the stor y even bigger amon g walkable city advoc ates. It also de mon strates how , legal or n ot , well-in ten tion ed citiz en -led action of ten obt ain s pol itical champi on s qu ickly, which then leads to t he pos sibility of lon g-term chan ge. Silver’s pr oa ctive respon se was doc umen ted in a fol low -up s tor y written by Emily Badger for the A tlant ic Cities . “Som etimes som ethin g surfaces that for ces you to r econ sider [or din an ces]. This is on e in stan ce that we said ‘what’s goi n g on here?’ This wasn ’t advertisin g pe r se. Yes, you n eed a pe rmit. But we have n ot seen this level of civic pa rticipa tion in my lifetime.”3 2 Matt To masulo han gin g up Walk [Yo ur City] sign s. (Matt To masulo ) When n ews ou tlets learn ed that the sign s were n ot san ction ed by the city, they in evitably asked, “Then why are they still up? ” This qu estion techn ically con stituted a for mal com pl ain t, an d the city was obl iged to r espon d by takin g the sign s dow n . When they were remove d, the citiz en s of Raleigh pr ot ested, assertin g that they liked the sign s. Sen sin g the risin g dispr ova l of the com mun ity, the city move d qu ickly to f igure ou t how to r ein state the campa ign . Silver tol d Tom asulo t hat they wou ld make it all happe n by makin g the pr oj ect a “pi lot pr og ram” of the city’s com pr ehen sive pl an . Elated, Tom asulo di d his pa rt by rallyin g com mun ity suppor t so t hat city cou n cil wou ld pa ss the resol ution . Turn in g to t he In tern et on ce again , Tom asulo qu ickly created a sign on .or g “Restor e Walk Raleigh” campa ign to de mon strate that there was pu blic suppor t for pu ttin g the sign s back up. Walk [Yo ur City] sign s. (Matt To masulo ) Within 3 da ys the pe tition sol icited 1,255 s ign atures, facilitated by Tom asulo’ s burgeon in g Facebook fol low in g. By the time the city cou n cil met, the item was all but for egon e con clusion . The city asked whether he’d be willin g to don ate the sign s back to the city for a 3- mon th, city-san ction ed pi lot pr oj ect. The city of ficially recog n iz ed that the pr oj ect was con sisten t with their goa ls, as stated in their Com pr ehen sive Plan , to in crease n on mot or iz ed mobi lity, en han ce bicycle an d pe destrian in frastructure, an d even expa n d wayfin din g sign s. Spu rred by the pr oj ect’s loc al success an d in tern ation al atten tion , Tom asulo’ s graduate school advisor allow ed him to c han ge the foc us of his master’s caps ton e pr oj ect so h e cou ld foc us in stead on scalin g the Walk Raleigh pr oj ect in itiative. Tom asulo e n vision ed a web pl atfor m where an yon e cou ld log on , custom iz e their ow n sign s, an d have them shippe d within days—z ip t ies in cluded. How ever, he wou ld first n eed som e wor kin g capi tal. To w iden the appe al beyon d his city, Tom asulo c han ged the n ame of the pr oj ect from Walk Raleigh to W alk [You r City] an d turn ed to K ickstarter, the on lin e crow dfun din g pl atfor m, to h elp r aise the fun ds. The Kickstarter staff took a shin e to h is pr oj ect an d pr om ot ed it on their fron t pa ge, where it garn ered mor e than $1 1,000 i n fun din g from 549 s uppor ters. This amou n t was mor e than twice the in itial $5,800 pr oj ect goa l, which was surpa ssed in just 8 da ys. “We qu ickly hit the fun din g mark, mos tly because pe opl e were willin g to don ate $15 w ithou t an y expe ctation of a reward,” says Tom asulo. By July 2012 T om asulo h ad built a small team an d was movi n g for ward with the creation of the Walk [You r City] templ ate, a beta version of which pr ovi ded editable sign templ ates for free dow n loa d. When this began to t ake of f, ot hers were so i n spi red by the pr oj ect that they began creatin g their ow n “guerrilla wayfin din g” pr oj ects. Within weeks of the Kickstarter campa ign , repl icas cou ld be fou n d in New Orlean s, Roc hester, Memph is, Dallas, an d Miami, amon g ot her cities. The dow n loa dable templ ate pr ove d that there was en ou gh deman d, an d com mun ities began askin g Tom asulo a n d his team to c reate campa ign s to e n cou rage walkin g. This was en ou gh justification to m or e fully build ou t the www. walkyou rcity. or g pl atfor m, which allow s an yon e to n ot on ly custom iz e the digital sign templ ate but also pu rchase the desired n umber an d have them shippe d to a spe cific loc ation within days. The site’s taglin e tells visitor s, “It’s n ot too f ar” an d pr ovi des case studies, in struction s an d best pr actices for han gin g the sign s, an d a blog cove rin g pr oj ects an d the gen eral move men t tow ard walkable cities. To da te, the pl atfor m has attracted mor e than 10,000 s ign templ ate dow n loa ds an d is bein g used in city an d citiz en -led pr oj ects arou n d the wor ld. Althou gh Tom asulo’ s effor ts took a large amou n t of en ergy, vision , an d sustain ed dedication , he claims that it has been wor th it. “Peopl e in com mun ities as small as 1,500 pe opl e to a s large as New Yor k City have used the sign s. It’s low cos t an d highly scalable. We’re pr ou d of that.” The pl atfor m has even begun to e arn som e reven ue, as loc al campa ign s, advoc ates, an d pr oj ect man agers begin to u se the tool an d track the data. Back in Raleigh, the Nor th Hills n eighbor hood h as in stalled n in ety-three sign s. Mor e than 200 pe opl e have scan n ed the sign s for digital walkin g direction s in a pe riod of 9 m on ths. Mor eove r, Tom asulo says he has been tol d by visitor s an d n eighbor s that althou gh they did n ot scan the sign , the in for mation on the sign s mot ivated them to t ake a walk they had n ever taken befor e. Tom asulo’ s wor k con tin ues to m ake an impa ct in his adopt ed city. In Jan uary 2013, appr ox imately 1 y ear after Matt hun g the sign s, the City of Raleigh vot ed to a dopt a fin er-grain ed com pr ehen sive pe destrian pl an , which in cludes the san ction ed use of Walk Raleigh sign s. This un san ction ed to s an ction ed pr oj ect trajector y is con sisten t with ot her leadin g appl ication s of citiz en -led Tactical Urban ism pr oj ects doc umen ted in this book an d elsewhere. There are man y lesson s to be drawn from the Walk [You r City] case study. Cen tral to a ll of Tom asulo’ s wor k is a suite of low -cos t web-based com mun ication an d pr oj ect creation tool s exempl ifyin g the pow er of radical con n ectivity. As a result, Tom asulo h as becom e a firm believer in accessible, easy-to- use on lin e tool s to de velop of flin e action . Tom asulo’ s wor k exempl ifies what’s com mon ly called civic techn ol og y, or “civic tech,” which allow s pe opl e, rather than gove rn men ts, to e ffect chan ge. Tom asulo’ s wor k demon strates how the do- it-you rself appr oa ch to c ivic in frastructure can qu ickly in fluen ce the con ven tion al pr oj ect delivery pr oc ess, an d it also u n derscor es the poi n t that on e can ’t go i t alon e for ever if the pr oj ect an d its ben efits are to be adopt ed an d spr ead elsewhere in the city. Mor eove r, Tom asulo’ s pr oj ect demon strates that successful Tactical Urban ism pr oj ects are an exercise in doc umen tation as much as they are in doi n g. In fact, a key aspe ct of the Walk Raleigh pr oj ect is that Tom asulo a n d his co- con spi rator s design ed mor e than just ph ysical sign s; they researched an d design ed a pr oc ess that cou ld in crease the chan ce of success, espe cially given the in itial illegality of the pr oj ect. The pr oc ess—research, pr ot ot ypi n g, testin g, an d learn in g—was deliberate. We’ll expl or e this appr oa ch in mor e detail in chapt er 5 , but it’s wor th n ot in g that when the pr oj ect garn ered atten tion , Tom asulo c ou ld clearly articulate why an d how he did the pr oj ect, which helpe d him for ge relation ships with city leaders an d staff, who qu ickly learn ed to see him as a civic leader wor th en ablin g rather than a trou blemaker. His web com mun ication pl atfor m also a llow ed him to c all on a grow in g n etwor k of suppor ters when the pr oj ect was threaten ed. So w here doe s the pr oj ect go n ext? Will cities acros s Nor th America begin to u se tempor ary wayfin din g sign s while the dol lars are scrape d tog ether for pe rman en t sign age? Will the Walk [You r City] effor t brin g in en ou gh reven ue to be sustain ed for ot hers to u se? Doe s it actually in crease walkability in cities?

He created Dallas’s first ‘New Yor k–style’ pa rkin g-pr ot ected cycle track.”3 7 How ard, who w as in stan tly en thralled with the actual doi n g in vol ved with the pr oj ect, called it a livin g charrette. “There I was, actually pa in tin g the bike lan es we n or mally design on a com pu ter screen . It was a very differen t an d tactile expe rien ce. I was hook ed.”3 8 The effor t cou ld be described as n ot on ly tactile but tactical as well. The or gan iz in g grou p i den tified the barriers to r evitaliz ation , established a vision for what they wan ted their n eighbor hood t o be com e, an d stayed discipl in ed by startin g with just a sin gle urban bloc k. To f acilitate the pr oj ect the grou p n eeded to obt ain a run -of -the-mill spe cial even t pe rmit from the City of Dallas. Almos t every city has such a pe rmit, which is a catchall allow in g bloc k pa rties, art festivals, roa d races, an d ot her even ts to oc cur in the street. The Better Bloc k grou p or gan iz ed the even t alon gside the Oak Cliff Art Crawl, which also r equ ires a spe cial even t pe rmit. This made it easier for the grou p t o obt ain pe rmission , because as far as the city was con cern ed, it was just an ot her art festival. How ever, the “art” in this pa rticular loc ation wasn ’t on can vases but in the pr ovi sion of n ewly created on -street pa rkin g, sidewalk din in g, sidewalk flow ers, pa rkin g-pr ot ected bike lan es, pop- up s hops , an d ot her amen ities that were ot herwise pr oh ibited or very difficult to a chieve. The street also r emain ed ope n to c ars, albeit with an altern ate con figuration . Accor din g to H ow ard, “We wan ted to m ake it realistic, to s how that we cou ld add all of these amen ities an d the cars cou ld still go t hrou gh.” True to t he spi rit of Tactical Urban ism, the Better Bloc k team wan ted n ot just to show what was pos sible but to s how how the amen ities created were made illegal by city regulation s. So t hey pr in ted all the or din an ces an d z on in g code rol es they were in ten tion ally viol atin g durin g the even t an d pu t them on displ ay for all to s ee.

The con versation this started amon g city leaders brou ght almos t immediate action to a ddress the ou tdated or din an ces, which alon e made the first Better Bloc k pr oj ect a success. Buildin g a Better Blo ck in Atlan ta. (Atlan ta Regio n al Co mmissio n ) First Build a Better Blo ck, Oak Cliff, Dallas. (Team Better Blo ck) Impr essively, it led to t he pe rman en t chan ge that the pr oj ect or gan iz ers desired, pe rhaps faster than an yon e expe cted. Accor din g to R obe rts, “Thos e or din an ces we wan ted chan ged were pu t on the City Cou n cil doc ket for discussion an d were chan ged almos t immediately to be mor e reflective of how we live n ow .

The in itial Better Bloc k pr oj ect was such a success that the City of Dallas soon requ ested the same appr oa ch to r api d revitaliz ation to be used in ot her loc ation s. An d with that, Team Better Bloc k was for med un der the leadership of Jason Robe rts an d An drew How ard. An d exactly 1 y ear after the first Better Bloc k, the team wor ked with the City of Dallas’s n ew City Design Studio t o h elp r ein vigor ate the lifeless City Hall Plaz a. In or der to u n derstan d how such a poor ly design ed pu blic spa ce cou ld com e back to l ife, Robe rts an d How ard dusted of f famed pu blic spa ce expe rt William “Hol ly” Whyte’s 1983 pl an for the very same spa ce.

Armed with this in for mation Robe rts an d How ard wor ked with city of ficials to create the Livin g Plaz a pr oj ect, which after the first successful demon stration pr oj ect was made in to a mon thly even t. The city’s website says it’s design ed to “ en gage city staff in a discussion abou t urban ism an d to de mon strate how great pu blic spa ces in crease qu ality of life, impr ove safety an d stimulate the econ om y.”3 9 The pr oj ect also en gages the surrou n din g com mun ity, in cludin g aspi rin g en trepr en eurs who a re in vited to test their ideas in the heart of Dallas befor e they file n ew busin ess pe rmits an d com mit to l eases.

At the ribbon -cuttin g ceremon y in December 2013, m ere days befor e she was to leave of fice, Sadik-Khan pr oc laimed, “With in n ova tive design s an d a little pa in t, we’ve show n you can chan ge a street qu ickly with immediate ben efits.”6 9 Green light for Midtow n ’s success cemen ted Sadik-Khan ’s legacy as on e of the mos t in ven tive city builders in the Un ited States. But the mun icipa lity-as-tactician appr oa ch in New Yor k City starts with a smaller grou p of DOT staffers in itially tasked with pr ovi din g safer pe destrian con dition s in low er Man hattan in the mid-1990s . A Brief Histo ry o f Plaz a Imp ro vemen ts in New Yo rk City Soc ietal tren ds, buttressed by federal pol icies that subsidiz ed urban decen traliz ation , began to t ake their tol l in US cities after Wor ld War II. Urban residen ts reloc atin g to t he suburbs in creased the n eed for American s to dr ive. As a result, un sn arlin g traffic became the sin gular obs ession of n ot on ly traffic en gin eers but pl an n ers, pol itician s, an d just abou t an yon e stuck on the roa d. As in man y cities, New Yor k respon ded by in creasin g roa d capa city to a ccom moda te a grow in g n umber of autom obi les. In tan dem with buildin g highways throu ghou t the metro a rea, New Yor k began n arrow in g sidewalks an d widen in g streets wherever pos sible. The city also be gan re pl acin g the two- way traffic pa ttern s fou n d alon g Man hattan ’s aven ues with on e-way flow , with the idea that these chan ges wou ld reduce vehicular con flict an d delay. By the early 1960s almos t all the aven ues received this mode rn traffic en gin eerin g treatmen t, in cludin g pa rts of Broa dway. By 1966 t he en tire stretch of Broa dway sou th of Col umbus Circle was a on e-way sou thbou n d thor ou ghfare. In ten ded to h elp t raffic move throu gh midtow n , the modi fication actually had the oppos ite effect. Its odd a n gle an d sou thbou n d traffic flow delayed traffic each time Broa dway cros sed an ot her n or th– sou th aven ue. Now here was this mor e n ot iceable than at n or thbou n d Sixth Aven ue in Herald Squ are. By con trast, Times Squ are allow ed bot h streams of sou th-bou n d traffic to pr oc eed simultan eou sly, with exceedin gly lon g cros swalk pe destrian sign als. At the same time that cities were tryin g to a ccom moda te mor e cars on the roa d, they were redesign in g select city streets for pe destrian s on ly to c om pe te with suburban shoppi n g cen ters. The idea was that brin gin g the foot traffic an d creature com for ts of an in door mall to M ain Street wou ld help r evitaliz e districts fast in declin e. In their 1977 book Pedes tr ians Onl y, Robe rto B rambilla an d Gian n i Lon go w rot e that “pe destrian malls are n ot urban idylls created in the artist’s eye, but pr actical sol ution s to s om e urgen t urban pr obl ems.”7 0 Between 1955 a n d 1980 m or e than 200 c om mercial streets were con verted to w alkin g-on ly thor ou ghfares in American cities large an d small. As en viron men tal activism grew throu ghou t the 1960s , pe destrian streets were seen as a way to c om bat the n egative impa cts of in creased auto de pe n den cy as much as flaggin g retail sales.7 1 As men tion ed in chapt er 3 , the Region al Plan Assoc iation en vision ed Times Squ are an d the Broa dway cor ridor as a pe destrian street as early as 1969. U n for tun ately, the pol itical com pl exity of clos in g on e of America’s den sest streets to a utom obi les at a time when traffic was in creasin g was n ot popu lar. The strategy lacked the n ecessary tactics an d favor able demog raph ic, econ om ic, an d soc ial con dition s that made the effor t a hom e run 40 y ears later. Mos t of the pe destrian malls impl emen ted at the time were n ot the savior dow n tow n boos ters wan ted them to be . In fact, man y are blamed for hasten in g the declin e of main street com mercial en viron men ts an d have sin ce been reope n ed to ve hicular traffic (appr ox imately 75 of the 200- pl us pe destrian malls remain toda y). Yet the factor s behin d the failure are too of ten simpl ified; main streets did n ot fail because autom obi les were depr ior itiz ed, they failed because much deepe r econ om ic shifts an d soc ial tren ds drove in vestmen t, residen tial popu lation s, an d street-level activity elsewhere. Paley Park is co n sidered o n e o f New Yo rk City’s mo st successful p rivately o wn ed p ublic sp aces. (Aleksan dr Zyko v) Other pr og rams impl emen ted by the city suppor ted the developm en t of pu blic spa ce elsewhere.

In deed, the shor tcom in gs of the POPS pr og ram became a subject of William Whyte’s semin al Soc ial Life of Smal l Ur ban Spac es (1980) , a meticulou s in qu iry in to w hat con stitutes a well-used, safe, an d con vivial pu blic spa ce.7 3 Whyte’s wor k un den iably helpe d impr ove pr ivately built an d main tain ed pu blic spa ces but did n ot fully address the challen ges of deliverin g such amen ities beyon d the city’s com mercial cor e or to t he in creasin gly auto- cen tric streets of America’s mos t walkable an d tran sit-rich city. Pilo tin g the Pilo ts Befor e the Green light for Midtow n pr oj ect, in the late 1990s , New Yor k City began to take smaller, in cremen tal steps to r evamp i ts ou tdated appr oa ch to pu blic spa ce an d street design . These smaller expe rimen tal pr oj ects were in valuable in impl emen tin g tempor ary pr oj ects citywide. At this time Ran dy Wade, a pe destrian pl an n er with the DOT, was assign ed in 1997 to i mpl emen t the Low er Man hattan Pedestrian iz ation Study. Un der n or mal circumstan ces, this wou ld in clude a 10- year pr oc ess to i mpl emen t a capi tal con struction pr oj ect. How ever, there was stron g pol itical will to do i t faster an d less expe n sively. With this charge Wade set ou t to n arrow Whitehall Street n ot with pe rman en t in frastructure but with in expe n sive an d tempor ary materials, creatin g a 2,000- squ are- foot lin ear median pl an tin g bed usin g the city’s stan dard jersey barriers. The barriers were pa in ted the col or celadon to m atch the Battery Maritime Buildin g, an d con sultan t Gail E. Wittwer created a small for est of birch an d pi n e. The pr oj ect team also or dered large but in expe n sive pl astic pl an ters to f urther delin eate pe destrian spa ce adjacen t to n ew high-visibility cros swalks. They cheekily dubbed the pr oj ect Whitehall Garden s. Embol den ed by effective use of low -cos t materials at Whitehall Garden s, the team took a similar appr oa ch to n arrow in g n earby Coe n ties Slip, a for mer in let used for shippi n g that was filled in with lan d an d tran sfor med in to a street in 1835. T he on e- bloc k stretch remain ed wider than mos t streets in Low er Man hattan an d served little to n o pu rpos e for autom obi le traffic. With the goa l of reclaimin g much of the spa ce for pe opl e, Wade ign or ed the recom men dation to pr ot ect pe destrian s with jersey barriers an d fou n d left-ove r gran ite bloc ks from a pr eviou s bridge pr oj ect to de sign ate the n ew pu blic spa ce.

The pr oj ect’s success brou ght a lon g-term capi tal in vestmen t by the DOT in 2004, which tran sfor med the spa ce further with pe rman en t materials. Althou gh this pi on eerin g appr oa ch to pu blic spa ce developm en t is con sidered textbook Tactical Urban ism an d is stan dard in New Yor k City toda y, the tempor ary-to- pe rman en t appr oa ch received little or n o a tten tion from thos e ou tside the area at the time. In terestin gly, the ot her half of Coe n ties Slip r ecen tly en tered the city’s curren t pl az a pr og ram an d at the time of this writin g was clos ed fully to a utom obi le traffic usin g n ot hin g but tempor ary bol lards, pl an ters, an d pa in t. After com pl etion of the Coe n ties Slip pr oj ect, Ran dy Wade an d her DOT col leagues were called back in 2006 t o de velop i n expe n sive of f-the-shelf pe destrian impr ove men ts in dow n tow n Brook lyn where a little-used street had been iden tified as an oppor tun ity. By this poi n t, Wade an d her col leagues kn ew what to do. T he DOT team pa rtn ered with the Metrot ech BID to f ashion an ot her pe destrian pl az a usin g tempor ary materials: fol din g tables an d chairs, table an d chair un its with umbrellas, pl astic pl an ters, an d whimsical bike racks. They were pl aced in a low -traffic bloc k on Willou ghby Street, wedged between Jay an d Adams Streets in dow n tow n Brook lyn . It was here that the idea of pa vemen t to pl az as began to be un derstood a s a scalable appr oa ch to br in gin g safety an d pu blic spa ce impr ove men ts citywide. Soon thereafter, the idea began to e xpa n d mor e qu ickly to ot her areas of the city an d was in cluded in the city’s lan dmark PlaNYC sustain ability an d qu ality-of -life effor t, ushered in by mayor Michael Bloom berg an d twen ty-five city depa rtmen ts in 2007. After the adopt ion of PlaNYC, the city took its n ew pa vemen t-to- pl az a pr og ram to t he n or thern edge of Man hattan ’s meatpa ckin g district, on Nin th Aven ue between West 13t h an d 16t h Streets, where the DOT reclaimed a wide swath of asph alt at the awkward in tersection of 9t h Aven ue an d 14t h Street. The pr oj ect took in spi ration from the materiality an d aesthetic of the crushed gravel fou n d in the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris. Wade realiz ed the epox y used to a ppl y n o- slip t raction to br idges cou ld be repu rpos ed for the asph alt where pl az a spa ce was to be created. The result is an attractive, easy to main tain , n on slip e n viron men t. Accor din g to W ade, “we fou n d the epox y–gravel mix on the In tern et an d selected a beige mot tled col or to c reate a really attractive, low -cos t surface treatmen t with a cool er tempe rature to w alk on than bare roa dbed.” The in itial appr oa ch Wade’s team took to pu blic spa ce en han cemen t in Low er Man hattan didn ’t take of f at first, accor din g to W ade, because mos t DOT staff, n ot to men tion fellow New Yor kers, were un aware of the pr oj ect an d its pot en tial scalability. “There wasn ’t much repl ication fol low in g that first pr oj ect in 1997,” Wade says, “because the treatmen ts were n ot that visible an d they were n ot con n ected to a larger pol itical or pol icy pl atfor m.” A decade later, the Willou ghby Plaz a pr oj ect was hailed as a sign al chan ge for n ewly or gan iz ed livable streets advoc ates. These advoc ates were able to s ee man y of their ideas in PlaNYC. Wade credits the rise of the New Yor k City Streets Ren aissan ce campa ign an d Streetsblog (fou n ded by Mark Gor ton an d edited by Aaron Napa rstek in 2006) , which became the mou thpi ece for the whol e move men t. The city—pol itical leaders, advoc ates, the busin ess com mun ity—col lectively learn ed that tempor ary pr oj ects are critical because they demon strate what a street can becom e. As Wade said, “They are better than a box of pa pe r studies, they let users walk throu gh, sit in , criticiz e, modi fy an d hope fully love a pl ace to t hen suppor t the n eed to m ake the tempor ary pe rman en t.”7 4 The safety an d econ om ic ben efits of this pa vemen t-to- pl az a pr og ram appr oa ch are sign ifican t, an d the DOT devot ed resou rces to c apt urin g an d pu bliciz in g them in the 2013 r epor t Meas ur ing t he Str eet: New Metr ics for 21s t Cent ur y Str eets .7 5 As in Times Squ are, the con version of un derused asph alt acros s the city has led to s ubstan tial in creases in pe destrian traffic, in creases in retail sales for existin g busin esses, an d an impr essive decrease in in juries for all street users. Mor eove r, man y of the pa vemen t-to- pl az as pr oj ects are becom in g pe rman en t, in cludin g Willou ghby Plaz a, where the city began pe rman en t con struction in 201 1 a n d held a ribbon cuttin g for the ope n in g in Apr il 2012. C learly, the shor t-term an d in expe n sive impr ove men ts are n ow an accept ed if n ot expe cted pa rt of the city’s street design tool kit. In a city where every in ch of spa ce is of value to s om eon e an d therefor e con tested, framin g these type s of pr oj ects as pi lot s pr ove d to be a pol itically deft man euver. Arden t defen ders of the status qu o w ere n eutraliz ed by the low cos t an d tempor ary n ature of the pr oj ects. If an y of the pr oj ects failed from a safety, retail, or qu ality-of -life pe rspe ctive, the city said they cou ld revert back to t he for mer con dition . Of cou rse, there has been pol itical pu shback alon g the way, but n eighbor hood ou treach an d the detailed col lection of befor e-an d-after data helpe d tell the stor ies of success (man y) an d failures (a few), which cou ld be accou n ted for in the n ext ph ase of a given pr oj ect.

As we have described, citiz en s may use Tactical Urban ism as a tool to dr aw atten tion to pe rceived shor tcom in gs in pol icy an d ph ysical design , an d mun icipa l author ities, or gan iz ation s, an d pr oj ect develope rs may use it as a tool to w iden the sph ere of pu blic en gagemen t, test aspe cts of a pl an early an d of ten , an d expe dite impl emen tation so t hat it’s easier to build great pl aces. We describe such in itiatives as tac tical because they use a deliberate an d accessible mean s for achievin g pr eset goa ls while embeddin g flexibility in to t he pl an n in g an d pr oj ect delivery pr oc ess. Usin g the framewor k of design thin kin g, in this chapt er we’ll expl ain ou r appr oa ch to a n y Tactical Urban ism pr oj ect, drawin g ou t spe cific lesson s for citiz en or gove rn men t tactician s wherever pos sible. Design Thin kin g The pr of ession aliz ation of the hackin g move men t has brou ght with it a n umber of techn iqu es an d pr oc esses for respon din g to n ew or pe rsisten t challen ges. On e such method i s “design thin kin g,” which is n ot so m uch a n ou n as a verb. The basis for design thin kin g develope d in the 1960s , but its con tempor ary appl ication was develope d at the Stan for d Design School an d the con sultin g firm IDEO un der the leadership of brot hers Tom an d David Kelley. In the book Cr eat ive Conf idenc e, the brot hers Kelley defin e the pr oc ess as com bin in g empa thy for the con text of a pr obl em, creativity in the gen eration of in sights an d sol ution s, an d ration ality in an alyz in g an d fittin g variou s sol ution s to t he pr obl em con text.1 In recen t years its popu larity has risen alon gside the grow th of techn ol og y start-ups , man y of which have adopt ed its cor e ten ets alon g with man y of the pr odu ct developm en t methods pr escribed in The Lean St ar tup , by Eric Ries.2 Design thin kin g is n ot a com pl etely for eign con cept to t he allied discipl in es of city buildin g. Peter Row e, a Harvard pr of essor of architecture an d urban design , adapt ed the idea to t he field in the 1987 book Des ign T hink ing . How ever, the con cept s pr esen ted in Row e’s book did n ot pe n etrate the field. But as techn ol og y firms an d start-ups have gain ed cultural cachet ove r the last two de cades, mor e atten tion has been pa id to h ow 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. the appl ication of con tempor ary design thin kin g doe s an d doe s n ot tran slate to c ity buildin g. In ou r expe rien ce the five-step de sign thin kin g pr oc ess is valuable for pr odu cin g successful Tactical Urban ism pr oj ects. Bot h design thin kin g an d Tactical Urban ism recog n iz e that design , like city buildin g, is a n ever-en din g pr oc ess where absol ute sol ution s are rarely if ever achieved. The steps are similar to t he pr obl em- iden tification -to- pr oj ect-respon se pr oc ess com mon ly used by Tactical Urban ists. The five steps are: Empa thiz e: Un derstan d for whom you are really pl an n in g or design in g. Defin e: Iden tify a spe cific oppor tun ity site an d clearly articulate the root causes of the pr obl ems that n eed to be addressed. Ideate: Research an d develop w ays to a ddress the defin ed pr obl em. Prot ot ype : Plan a pr oj ect respon se that can be carried ou t qu ickly an d withou t great expe n se. Test: Use the build–measure–learn pr oc ess to t est the pr oj ect an d gather feedback. Design thin kin g. (The Streets Plan Co llabo rative) These steps do n ot n eed to be fol low ed in a lin ear fashion , they of ten ove rlap, a n d they shou ld be repe ated as n eeded. The steps shou ld be con sidered a framewor k for addressin g a variety of urban pr obl ems writ large. The how -to pr oc ess described in the pa ges ahead pr ovi des details for how you can appl y it to y ou r wor k. 1 . Emp athiz e: Un derstan d fo r who m yo u are Plan n in g o r Design in g All Tactical Urban ism pr oj ects seek to a ddress a deficien cy in the built en viron men t. How ever, an effective pr oj ect respon se can n ot be develope d un til you un derstan d for whom you are really wor kin g. Often , you are wor kin g for you , but also f rien ds, family, or un wittin g n eighbor s. In dividually or col lectively, you grow tired of a run dow n buildin g, an un used pa rkin g lot , or an ove rly wide street, so y ou take action , with or withou t pe rmission . Althou gh this can be effective, it’s impor tan t to c on sider who e lse may be affected by you r pr oj ect so t hat you can take their n eeds in to a ccou n t as well. How wou ld you r ol der n eighbor dow n the street, the shop ow n er on the cor n er, or the child n ext door respon d? First, we advoc ate askin g them; even if you are n ot seekin g to a ddress their n eeds spe cifically, it’s impor tan t that you r pr oj ect n ot make thin gs wor se for them. If you receive feedback abou t the pot en tial of n egative impa cts, you can make adjustmen ts. On the ot her side of the coi n , you ’ll pr oba bly fin d you ’re n ot the on ly on e who h as been adversely affected by an un desirable elemen t in you r n eighbor hood. T akin g a shot at makin g thin gs better will also a ttract like-min ded pe opl e who h ave of ten thou ght to un dertake a similar pr oj ect. For thos e wor kin g in a pr of ession al capa city, a clien t, a loc al pol itician , or a depa rtmen t leader may determin e som e or almos t all aspe cts of a pr oj ect in advan ce.

So w ith all the pos sibilities, how do y ou choos e a good on e? Site Selectio n : At Wha t Sca le? Scale an d ph ysical con text matter tremen dou sly in the site selection pr oc ess. When we have a choi ce, we like to a ppl y Tactical Urban ism to pl aces that feature base con dition s that exist elsewhere. If it is successful, the chan ce that the pr oj ect respon se cou ld be adopt ed elsewhere or for mally adopt ed in to m un icipa l pl an n in g an d pol icy is in creased.

Gettin g this right will of ten lead to t he n ext pr oj ect oppor tun ity, ph ase, or loc ation .

Thus, we recom men d visitin g you r loc al library, the mun icipa l archives, or the web to f in d useful in for mation befor e fully defin in g the oppor tun ities at han d. The Five Whys On ce the oppor tun ity site is selected an d un derstood bot h ph ysically an d histor ically, it will be impor tan t to de fin e the root cause of the challen ges fou n d there. This may oc cur in a n umber of ways, but we suggest tryin g “the Five Whys,” a techn iqu e develope d by Sakichi Toy oda to opt imiz e his com pa n y’s auto m an ufacturin g pr oc ess. Toy oda obs erved that pr obl ems in man ufacturin g are of ten the result of flawed pr oc esses, which can be discove red qu ickly by simpl y askin g “why?” multipl e times (he fou n d five to be ideal). This simpl e exercise is kn ow n to pr odu ce impor tan t in sights, has becom e a key pa rt of the lean man ufacturin g pr oc ess champi on ed globa lly, an d is used by a variety of creative discipl in es as well. We’ve adopt ed the Five Whys exercise in to m an y of ou r Tactical Urban ism wor kshops because the weakn esses pe opl e are so qu ick to poi n t ou t in their n eighbor hoods are typi cally the ph ysical man ifestation of som ethin g beyon d the pe rceived pr obl em: a flawed human pr oc ess, an ou tdated an d for got ten mun icipa l pol icy, or som e ot her root cause n on e of us thin k to a ddress.

Repe at this pr oc ess as man y times as n ecessary un til you feel like you ’ve arrived at on e or mor e of the root causes.

You may also a rrive at a few com pe tin g root causes that will requ ire in creased dialog ue or the n eed to t est multipl e pr oj ect respon ses. That bein g said, we’ve fou n d that the Five Whys exercise helps us qu ickly defin e an d pr ior itiz e the type s of challen ges an d oppor tun ity sites that n eed to be addressed first. From there, the fun can begin with a mor e foc used rou n d of brain stor min g. This shou ld foc us on creatin g a pr oj ect respon se in the shor t term that is in ten ded to m ake an impa ct on pol icy, pr oc ess, or ph ysical design in the lon g term. 3 . Ideate: Research an d Develo p ways to Address the Defin ed Pro blem Brain stor min g pr oj ect ideas—ideation —is on e of the mos t delightful aspe cts of the Tactical Urban ism pr oc ess. All ideas shou ld be con sidered as lon g as they use the kn ow ledge gain ed from step 1 ( Empa thiz e) an d are foc used on addressin g the challen ges an d oppor tun ities defin ed in step 2 ( Defin e). The ideation pr oc ess may happe n with in dividuals, small grou ps , or even large assemblies. For exampl e, Matt Tom asulo de velope d the Walk Raleigh campa ign on his ow n , the first Build a Better Bloc k was the ou tgrow th of a small n umber of dedicated an d creative Dallas residen ts, an d the Bayfron t Parkway pr oj ect in vol ved n o f ewer than thirty Miami or gan iz ation s. Each appr oa ch has value. For in stan ce, in dividuals an d small grou ps can of ten move qu ickly throu gh the first two s teps of the design thin kin g pr oc ess an d develop i n tern al con sen sus an d use resou rces efficien tly. Larger grou ps allow pr oj ect pr opon en ts to build broa der con sen sus an d tap i n to g reater n etwor ks. This can en rich the ideation pr oc ess an d will pr ove valuable when it’s time to s ou rce pr oj ect fun din g, materials, vol un teers, an d marketin g assistan ce. That said, developi n g a wide n etwor k is a ben efit at an y stage: The soon er pe opl e get in vol ved with an in terven tion , the soon er they take ow n ership of the pr oj ect. Althou gh the siz e of the grou p a n d ideation methods will vary, the task shou ld always in vol ve figurin g ou t what to do a n d how to do i t. Merely mimickin g a successful pr oj ect is pe rilou s because it’s difficult to ascertain the soc ial, econ om ic, pol itical, an d ph ysical con text in which the pr oj ect takes pl ace. Wha t to Do ? The mos t basic pr oj ect ideation techn iqu e is to l ook at the wor k of ot hers. Than ks to t he In tern et, researchin g is easier an d faster than ever befor e. Thus, it’s likely that you ’ll fin d several blog pos ts, n ews articles, an d self-made You -Tube videos doc umen tin g where creative an d scalable appr oa ches were used to t ackle com mon challen ges. We certain ly do t his early an d of ten for all ou r Tactical Urban ism pr oj ects. How ever, like an y search for pr eceden ts, it shou ld be on e for in spi ration an d helpf ul in for mation . Merely mimickin g a successful pr oj ect is pe rilou s because it’s difficult to a scertain the soc ial, econ om ic, pol itical, an d ph ysical con text in which the pr oj ect takes pl ace. Yet too of ten this is what we human s do: We seek to m imic success throu gh imitation . An en dless n umber of creative wor kshop t echn iqu es an d idea-gatherin g tool s are available for use in pl an n in g pr oj ects, beyon d settin g up f lip c harts an d layin g ou t markers on a map. F or ope n pu blic in itiatives, the com bin ation of bot h on lin e an d in - pe rson ideation pl atfor ms, such as Neighbor lan d (https : // www. n eighbor lan d. or g), are the mos t effective because they make doc umen tin g, sharin g, an d con n ectin g pr oj ect ideas in you r n eighbor hood e asier an d mor e effective than ever. Neighbor lan d is the ou tgrow th of artist an d urban pl an n er Can dy Chan g’s “I Wish This Was…” pr oj ect, which began with the pl ayful tweakin g of n ame tag stickers, which were then pl aced on vacan t or blighted buildin gs so t hat pa ssersby cou ld share their reuse ideas for pos t- Katrin a New Orlean s. A simp le in stallatio n usin g Neighbo rlan d stickers en gages p assersby in co n siderin g what co n stitutes a Lifelo n g Co mmun ity.

In pa rticular, ease of use an d a visually pl easin g in terface are drivin g the dramatic in crease in the use of on lin e tool s. But are they wor th it? It depe n ds on the pr oj ect an d the con text (an d fun din g). Merely allow in g the pu blic to c ast vot es or discuss pr oj ects on lin e is a certain kin d of pa rticipa tion , on e that can add value. How ever, som etimes these tool s are used as pa rt of con ven tion al in itiatives look in g to g oos e pr oj ect pa rticipa tion n umbers. Eric Ries calls these “van ity metrics.”3 Sure, in creased clickthrou gh pa rticipa tion can make us all feel good. B ut after the ideation pr oc ess is com pl eted, a few qu estion s almos t always remain : Now what? Are the ideas an d pr oj ects action able? Did the on lin e tool actually help f acilitate of flin e col labor ation an d impl emen tation ? These kin ds of qu estion s lead to w hat Ries calls “action able metrics,” which shou ld be used to pr ovi de a clearer pa th for ward. For Tactical Urban ism pr oj ects, action able metrics shou ld be established so t hat pr oj ect ideas advan ce qu ickly to t he pr ot ot ype an d testin g ph ases described in the pa ges ahead. We turn to E verett Rog ers, an early soc iol og y schol ar of in n ova tion , to h elp y ou con sider the “action ability” of you r Tactical Urban ism pr oj ect ideas. In the semin al text Diffus ion of Innov at ions (1962) , Rog ers iden tifies five factor s that in fluen ce whether we human s adopt or reject in n ova tion : relative advan tage, com pa tibility, simpl icity, trialability, an d obs ervability.4 Althou gh much of his writin g foc uses on the spr ead of techn ol og y, each of these factor s may be turn ed in to a qu estion durin g the pr oj ect ideation ph ase to h elp y ou thin k throu gh whether you r shor t-term pr oj ect respon se will effectively address the pr obl em you ’ve defin ed an d ultimately lead to l on g-term chan ge. Relat ive adv ant age : Will the pr oj ect actually pr ovi de an advan tage ove r the status qu o f or an iden tified grou p of pe opl e? Com pat ibi lity: Is the pr oj ect com pa tible with its soc ial an d ph ysical con text, in bot h scale an d scope ? Simpl icity: Can the pr oj ect be easily un derstood by a wide segmen t of the popu lation ? Tr ial abi lity: Can the pr oj ect be tested easily? Can it be easily repl icated elsewhere? Is the pa th to a dopt ion clear an d relatively hurdle free? Obs er vabi lity: Is the pr oj ect goi n g to be visible to m an y ot hers? Will it attract use an d atten tion ? Askin g these qu estion s will ben efit you r pr oj ect tremen dou sly. Ho w to get Sta r ted: Sa n ctio n ed Ver s us Un s a n ctio n ed Pr o jects There are on ly two w ays to a ppr oa ch a Tactical Urban ism pr oj ect: with pe rmission or withou t. An d the ideation stage is the pe rfect time to de cide the right pa th to pu rsue. If you have n ever taken on a pr oj ect in pa rtn ership w ith the city but are con siderin g it, then it’s best to t alk to s om eon e with som e expe rien ce wor kin g with loc al gove rn men t. So- called mun icipa l tactician s do e xist, an d their rol e is to g uide en terpr isin g pe opl e like you throu gh a multitude of mun icipa l pr oc esses or spot light pol icy or pe rmittin g wor karou n ds that help y ou deliver the results they kn ow ben efit the city but they themselves may struggle to a chieve. Un for tun ately, mun icipa l tactician s who r elish this rol e are hard to f in d, because they of ten wor k with little fan fare an d are con dition ed to de flect atten tion . Again , ask som eon e with loc al expe rien ce who m ight give you the right n ames from the right depa rtmen t. From there you can make a mor e in for med decision abou t whether to pu rsue a san ction ed or un san ction ed pr oj ect appr oa ch. If you are a gove rn men t empl oy ee—self-iden tifyin g mun icipa l tactician or n ot —the an swer is usually clear. Overt action carried for ward withou t the backin g of mun icipa l pr oc ess is usually frow n ed upon , if n ot grou n ds for you r cen sure or even dismissal. As you might kn ow all too w ell, this results in a risk-averse culture at city hall that of fers little or n o r eward for disrupt in g the status qu o. S till, in n ova tive bureaucrats are in creasin gly fin din g ways to s lash red tape , help pr oj ect creator s fin d the right looph ol e, or en able n ew type s of pr oj ects throu gh the for mulation of n ew pol icy (see the stor y of New Yor k’s pa vemen t-to- pl az as pr og ram in chapt er 4 ). We gen erally recom men d that pr oj ect pr opon en ts con sider a city or or gan iz ation ally san ction ed appr oa ch if two or mor e of the fol low in g con dition s are met: The pr oj ect is large in scale an d com pl ex in n ature. Rou ghly, this mean s som ethin g that may requ ire the use of city pr ope rty, mor e than a few hou rs to i mpl emen t, or mor e than a mode st amou n t of fun din g. Proj ect champi on s are likely or have already been iden tified an d are willin g an d able to h elp pr opon en ts obt ain or expe dite pe rmits (if n eeded), assist with in suran ce an d liability con cern s, help s ou rce n eeded materials, an d even pr ovi de fun din g (if you ’re lucky). The pr opos ed pr oj ect may be tied to a curren t pl an n in g effor t or is con sisten t with existin g pl an s, pol icies, or pr oj ect delivery pr ot oc ol s. Creative city an d or gan iz ation al leaders in terested in Tactical Urban ism will n eed the pol itical cove r to h elp j ustify their assistan ce with the effor t. Un for tun ately, few city gove rn men ts are set up t o e n able or depl oy Tactical Urban ism pr oj ects. As a result, citiz en -led action ten ds to s hoc k the system, which is pe rhaps best exempl ified by the chapt er 4 stor ies of in tersection repa ir we highlighted in Por tlan d, Oregon an d Hamilton , On tario. Y et cities of all siz es stan d to be n efit from these expr ession s of civic pa rticipa tion an d shou ld realiz e that small legal in fraction s are won derful oppor tun ities to e n gage in a dialog ue with pr oj ect pr opon en ts (an d oppon en ts) abou t how the city can best address their con cern s. To be sure, we advise that city leaders foc us less on the illegality of tempor ary in terven tion s of this sor t an d mor e on the un derlyin g con dition s that cause con stituen ts to a ct withou t city pe rmission in the first pl ace. When cities do t his an d treat their citiz en ry as co- creator s, n ot as scof flaws or van dals, the respon se is usually met with tremen dou s respe ct an d suppor t from the discern in g pu blic. In this way, the un san ction ed-to- san ction ed exampl es we shared in chapt er 4 (In tersection Repa ir, Walk Raleigh, Park(in g) Day, Build a Better Bloc k) demon strate that mun icipa l gove rn men t can an d shou ld wor k pr oa ctively with citiz en leaders rather than crack dow n on their activity. Such pr oj ects are highly visible an d shou ld be con sidered a low -cos t way to e n gage a wider audien ce of pe opl e. Althou gh san ction ed pr oj ects of ten pr ovi de legitimacy (an d fun din g) from the begin n in g, they may take man y mon ths if n ot years to c om e to f ruition . But un san ction ed pr oj ects can be com pl eted very qu ickly because urban tactician s gen erally hope for the best an d rely on expl oi tin g looph ol es (like Park[in g] Day) or askin g for for given ess later. We gen erally recom men d that pr oj ect pr opon en ts con sider an un san ction ed appr oa ch if two or mor e of the fol low in g con dition s are met: The in terven tion is small in scale an d easy to pu ll of f. All con ceivable san ction ed chan n els have been pu rsued an d mun icipa l leaders seem un willin g to a ddress existin g pl an s, pol icies, an d pr oj ect delivery pr ot oc ol s with the pr opos ed pr oj ect. No m un icipa l pe rmit or san ction ed pr oc ess wor karou n ds can be iden tified. A high level of con fiden ce exists that the pr oj ect will be viewed favor ably (or at least with in differen ce) by abutters, n eighbor s, an d ot her com mun ity members. Of cou rse, this type of wor k doe sn ’t com e withou t risk. Just ask An thon y Carden as, a Vallejo, C alifor n ia residen t who w as arrested for pa in tin g a high-visibility cros swalk (with z ebra stripe s) acros s the busy fou r-lan e Son om a Bou levard. Havin g witn essed several crashes an d n early becom in g a victim of traffic viol en ce himself, Carden as took matters in to h is ow n han ds after city en gin eers ign or ed his requ ests. A week later, the pa in t was traced back to t he sou rce an d he was arrested. How ever, an an on ymou s don or pa id the $15,000 ba il, an d Carden as was given a hero’ s welcom e upon return in g to t he n eighbor hood. 5 On e grateful n eighbor , an empl oy ee of a n earby hair salon , tol d the loc al n ewspa pe r, “We have a spe cial pl ace in ou r heart for him because we have a busin ess here, an d we’re all wom en , an d we get ou t very late.…He will walk us ou t to ou r cars an d make sure everythin g’s fin e.… This is a very bad street.”6 It shou ld be recog n iz ed that even in cases where citiz en s illegally in terven e on pu blic pr ope rty, the in ten t is rarely, if ever, maliciou s. In addition , if un san ction ed pr oj ects are to s ucceed in the lon g term, they iron ically must return to t he bureaucratic pr oc esses the pr opon en ts hope d to a voi d in the first pl ace. Thus, in the lon g run citiz en tactician s shou ld expe ct to w or k within in stitution al an d pol itical pr oc esses to r ealiz e pe rman en t chan ge. Likewise, in stitution s an d mun icipa l gove rn men ts will kn ow pr oj ect pr opon en ts are seriou s when they are seekin g col labor ation for the lon g term. Althou gh arrests are very rare, they do h appe n . The case of An thon y Carden as is on e un for tun ate exampl e. How ever, we’ve still n ever heard of an yon e bein g seriou sly hurt or killed as a result of an un san ction ed Tactical Urban ism pr oj ect. We wish we cou ld say the same abou t the dan gerou s, san ction ed status qu o c on dition s so m an y Tactical Urban ists take on . 4 . Pro to typ e: Plan a Pro ject Resp o n se Quickly an d In exp en sively On ce a defin itive site an d pr oj ect respon se have emerged—the n eed to c alm traffic, make a bus stop m or e com for table, or develop a n eighbor hood g atherin g spa ce—it’s time to de sign a lightweight an d in expe n sive version of the idealiz ed lon g-term respon se. Call it an in terven tion , a pr ot ot ype , a pi lot , whatever. Just make sure you move the idea to a ction qu ickly. The Bayfro n t Parkway Plan en visio n ed tran sfo rmin g a p arkin g lo t in to a large p o p -up p ark. (The Street Plan s Co llabo rative) Pr o ject Pla n n in g Althou gh man y Tactical Urban ism pr oj ects, san ction ed or n ot , may appe ar to be spon tan eou s, even the lightest in terven tion requ ires s om e pl an n in g. This in cludes con siderin g the ph ysical design but also l og istical elemen ts such as who ( if an yon e) will help, w hen to u n dertake the pr oj ect, how the pr oj ect will be fun ded, an d what materials shou ld be used. At this stage, it’s impor tan t to r emember that what makes you r pr oj ect tactical is the in ten t; the shor t-term in terven tion shou ld be pl aced within a framewor k for deliverin g lon g-term chan ge. To do t his, we of ten use a pr oc ess called 48x 48x 48, w hich was develope d in 201 1 a lon gside DoT an k: Brook lyn for a pr oj ect we com pl eted in dow n tow n Oyster Bay, New Yor k. In shor t, the 48x 48x 48 pr oc ess in ten tion ally lin ks the immediacy of a 48- hou r in terven tion with two a ddition al an d subsequ en t time scales: 48 weeks (shor t term) an d 48 m on ths (medium term). The “48” is arbitrary, but the poi n t is to a ccept the limitation s of the typi cal 20- year pl an an d to bu ild flexibility in to s hor ter feedback loops so t hat shiftin g pr ior ities an d con dition s can be accou n ted for . It is for this reason that we advoc ate limitin g the Tactical Urban ism pr oj ect timelin e to 4 or 5 years, at least at first.

As impor tan t as measurin g just abou t everythin g has becom e, Tactical Urban ism pr oj ects may be judged almos t in stan tly, of ten upon delivery: a vacan t lot is clean ed up an d tran sfor med in to a poc ket pa rk where pe opl e gather, a sin gle-car pa rkin g spa ce is turn ed in to bi ke pa rkin g, citiz en s han g repl ica spe ed limit sign s directin g mot or ists to drive slow er, an d it wor ks—or maybe n ot . Ultimately, the value of Tactical Urban ism is derived from testin g assumpt ion s throu gh ph ysical design that can be viewed ope n ly. But if you are n ot measurin g the impa ct, you are writin g on ly half the stor y. For tun ately, measuremen t tool s an d key metrics again st which to j udge success are n ow mor e accessible to c itiz en s an d gove rn men t of ficials than ever befor e. These in clude low -cos t ways to c ou n t bicycle an d pe destrian vol umes, decibels, traffic spe ed, retail sales, an d an y n umber of ot her qu alitative or qu an titative data poi n ts that com mun icate success or failure. The reason Tactical Urban ism wor ks in the pol itical sph ere is that it helps un bun dle the risk assoc iated with alterin g the status qu o. I t helps us on ce again learn con tin uou sly what wor ks an d what doe sn ’t, an d that’s the whol e poi n t. Lea r n How cities learn has chan ged dramatically in recen t years. Feedback loops have shor ten ed, data have becom e mor e abun dan t, an d it seems like we’re fumblin g a little less in the dark as ou r pr oc esses brin g light to w hat wor ks an d what doe sn ’t. Perhaps n o on e demon strates this n ew appr oa ch better than graduate studen ts at Ken t State’s Urban Design Col labor ative, who de velope d a week-lon g “com pl ete an d green street” expe rimen t in 2012 a lon g fou r bloc ks of Roc kwell Aven ue in dow n tow n Clevelan d. An drew Ho ward o f Team Better Blo ck reco rds traffic sp eed.

It in cluded the city’s first cycle track, bio- in filtration ben ches, impr ove d tran sit waitin g areas, an d win d-an imated pu blic art.1 1 Thus, it was as much an exercise in buildin g as it was in assessin g the impa ct an d learn in g—rapi dly—what wor ked an d what did n ot . Over the cou rse of the week, studen ts used time-laps e ph ot og raph y, film, in terviews, an d ot her for ms of data col lection . The pr oj ect un cove red n umerou s lesson s for future design effor ts: Twice as man y pe opl e cycled on the street as befor e, busin esses were n ot ultimately bot hered by the los s of pa rkin g, an d buses cou ld con tin ue with their man euverin g. How ever, pe rhaps mos t impor tan t is that the grou p of studen ts learn ed very qu ickly that their in tersection design treatmen ts (for the bikeway) cou ld be further impr ove d to pr even t mot or ists from drivin g in the cycle track, that the pu blic art cou ld be made mor e clear, an d that 1 w eek, thou gh very valuable, is simpl y too s hor t a time frame to g et defin itive results. Rather than learn these lesson s after years of pl an n in g an d million s of dol lars spe n t on pe rman en t in frastructure, the studen ts were able to bu ild the pr oj ect, measure the impa ct, an d learn qu ickly what shou ld be made pa rt of the n ext pr oj ect ph ase. From start to f in ish, this pr oc ess took on e semester, n ot years, an d pr ovi ded a smarter, mor e n imble, an d mor e effective way to de liver on the pr om ises of the city’s recen t pl an n in g in itiatives so t hat mon ey is n ot wasted with ot herwise un in for med pr oc esses. If on ly mos t street design pr oj ects were develope d this way! In deed, if som e aspe cts of a pr oj ect wor k well, then it’s a good i dea to dou ble dow n on the pos itive ou tcom es while also l earn in g from the elemen ts that don ’t wor k so w ell.

Let’s be hon est: 4 y ears is n ot that lon g! How ever, we’ve learn ed a great deal by doi ng —first by writin g the Tactical Urban ism guides, then by wor kin g alon gside pa ssion ate citizen s, in n ova tive gove rn men t leaders, smart develope rs, an d for ward-thin kin g advoc acy or gan ization s. What we’ve learn ed is that Tactical Urban ism did n ot just materialize; it has always been pa rt of how we build cities. Human settlemen ts existed for thou san ds of years as vern acular respon ses to pr actical everyday n eeds, lon g befor e an y cen tralized, top- dow n citymakin g en deavor was established. An d as the David Harvey qu ot e impl ies, it is in n ate in pe opl e to w an t to s hape the en viron men t that surrou n ds them. Yet in toda y’s highly regulated an d bureaucratic wor ld, allow in g for a citizen -led developm en t of the city an d the ritual use of pu blic spa ce is of ten n ever con sidered. Why? These appr oa ches must be pr ior itized. An in creasin g n umber of citizen s wan t to co- develop n eighbor hood pr oj ects rather than have city leaders an d con sultan ts alon e lead the way, an d for that reason (an d ot hers) we’ve expe n ded a fair amou n t of en ergy defin in g the Tactical Urban ism move men t in this book . We’ve also r elished the oppor tun ity to di g further in to i ts histor y an d to s hare a few of ou r favor ite exampl es. But mor e than an ythin g, it has served as a poi n t of reflection . We don ’t see Tactical Urban ism as a sin gle idea. It is bot h an adapt ation an d an exten sion of the timeless pr in cipl es that have always made ou r cities wor th in habitin g. Our pos ition is that the ideas pr esen ted in this book pr ovi de a critical an d too of ten missin g step i n the jou rn ey tow ard creatin g still mor e com pa ct, walkable, equ itable, an d, we hope , con vivial pl aces to l ive tog ether. To t hat en d, we wan t to s ee ou r streets an d n eighbor hoods live up t o t heir pot en tial.

Gove rn men ts are pos ition ed to m ake it easy for good t hin gs to h appe n in cities by removi n g on erou s an d ou tdated regulation s; from makin g it easier to a dd “gran n y flats” to r educin g the pa pe rwor k in vol ved in in frastructure pr oj ects, to pr ovi din g an easy-to- use pa rklet pr og ram, regulation s must be reduced an d the pr oj ect delivery system simpl ified. An d for God’ s sake, get it all on lin e! These are all goa ls that can be achieved by in cor por atin g the man y ideas pr esen ted in this book . But to g et “lighter, cheape r, qu icker” results, we must n ot on ly rethin k existin g pr oc esses for mun icipa l an d develope r-led pr oj ects but en able the pa ssion ate co- creator s, advoc acy grou ps , an d ot hers strivin g for urban livability toda y, n ot in 50 years. The term Tac tical U r bani s m has com e to de scribe this move men t. But althou gh it’s truly caught on , we are the first to r ecog n ize that it’s an ot her exampl e of pl an n in g jargon , an d that pu ts distan ce between pe opl e an d thos e who s erve them (i.e., we the author s an d man y of you readers). That’s n ot ou r goa l. So i f you fin d that the term is of fpu ttin g or in accessible to s om e popu lation s of pe opl e you wor k with an d for , con sider usin g som ethin g else. “Action pl an n in g” an d “pl an n in g by doi n g” are two c om mon repl acemen ts. No m atter what you call the wor k, we hope that after you fin ish readin g this book you ’ll un derstan d that what truly matters is the scope an d in ten t of the pr oj ects an d the in tegrity of the pr oc ess. Fin ally, the grow th of the Tactical Urban ism move men t has com e at a fascin atin g if n ot daun tin g mom en t in time. As rapi d urban ization con tin ues, on e thin g is clear: Human , econ om ic, an d n atural resou rces will on ly becom e mor e strain ed as we con tin ue to g rappl e with globa l climate chan ge an d the dimin ishin g return s of globa lism.

We’re in spi red by this challen ge in ou r ow n wor k an d are happy to h ave shared with you a mor e in -dept h look at how ot hers have don e this successfully, but n ot withou t failures an d setbacks. Ultimately, we challen ge you to t ake action where it might matter to y ou mos t: in fron t of you r hou se, on you r street, or in you r n eighbor hood. A fter all, if we can ’t wor k col lectively—fellow citizen s, gove rn men t leaders, or bot h—to m ake these pl aces better, we’ll certain ly have a hard time doi n g so a t an y larger scale.
