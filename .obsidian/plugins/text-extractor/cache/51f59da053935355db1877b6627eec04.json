1995-1-1 :2004+A1 :2008 (E) Foreword This European Standard EN 1995-1-1 has been prepared by Technical Committee CENITC250 \"Structural Eurocodes\", the Secretariat of which is held by BSI. This European Standard shall be given the status of a National Standard, either by publication of an identical text or by endorsement, at the latest by May 2005, and conflicting national standards shall be withdrawn at the latest by March 2010. This European Standard supersedes ENV 1995-1-1: 1993. CEN/TC250 is responsible for all Structural Eurocodes. According to the CEN/CENELEC Internal Regulations, the national standards organizations of the following countries are bound to implement this European Standard: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom. Background of the Eurocode programme In 1975, the Commission of the European Community decided on an action programme in the field of construction, based on article 95 of the Treaty. The objective of the programme was the elimination of technical obstacles to trade and the harmonisation of technical specifications. Within this action programme, the Commission took the initiative to establish a set of harmonised technical rules for the design of construction works which, in a first stage, would serve as an alternative to the national rules in force in the Member States and, ultimately, would replace them. For fifteen years, the Commission, with the help of a Steering Committee with Representatives of Member States, conducted the development of the Eurocodes programme, which led to the first generation of European codes in the 1980s. In 1989, the Commission and the Member States of the EU and EFTA decided, on the basis of an agreement1 between the Commission and CEN, to transfer the preparation and the publication of the Eurocodes to CEN through a series of Mandates, in order to provide them with a future status of European Standard (EN). This links de facto the Eurocodes with the provisions of all the Council's Directives and/or Commission's Decisions dealing with European standards (e.g. the Council Directive 89/106/EEC on construction products - CPD - and Council Directives 93/37/EEC, 92/50/EEC and 89/440/EEC on public works and services and equivalent EFTA Directives initiated in pursuit of setting up the internal market). The Structural Eurocode programme comprises the following standards generally consisting of a number of Parts: EN 1990 :2002 EN 1991 EN 1992 EN 1993 EN 1994 EN 1995 EN 1996 EN 1997 Eurocode: Basis of Structural Design Eurocode l' Actions on structures Eurocode 2: Design of concrete structures Eurocode 3: Design of steel structures Eurocode 4: Design of composite steel and concrete structures Eurocode 5: Design of timber structures Eurocode 6: Design of masonry structures Eurocode 7: Geotechnical design 1 Agreement between the Commission of the European Communities and the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) concerning the work on EUROCODES for the design of building and civil engineering works (8C/CEN/03/89). 7 BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995·1-1 :2004+A 1 :2008 (E) EN 1998 EN 1999 Eurocode 8: Design of structures for earthquake resistance Eurocode 9: Design of aluminium structures Eurocode standards recognise the responsibility of regulatory authorities in each Member State and have safeguarded their right to determine values related to regulatory safety matters at national level where these continue to vary from State to State. Status and field of application of Eurocodes The Member States of the EU and EFTA recognise that Eurocodes serve as reference documents for the following purposes: as a means to prove compliance of building and civil engineering works with the essential requirements of Council Directive 89/1 06/EEC, particularly Essential Requirement N°1 - Mechanical resistance and stability - and Essential Requirement N°2 Safety in case of fire; as a basis for specifying contracts for construction works and related engineering services; - as a framework for drawing up harmonised technical specifications for construction products (ENs and ETAs) The Eurocodes, as far as they concern the construction works themselves, have a direct relationship with the Interpretative Documents2 referred to in Article 12 of the CPO, although they are of a different nature from harmonised product standards3 . Therefore, technical aspects arising from the Eurocodes work need to be adequately considered by CEN Technical Committees and/or EOTA Working Groups working on product standards with a view to achieving full compatibility of these technical specifications with the Eurocodes. The Eurocode standards provide common structural design rules for everyday use for the design of whole structures and component products of both a traditional and an innovative nature. Unusual forms of construction or design conditions are not specifically covered and additional expert consideration will be required by the designer in such cases. National Standards implementing Eurocodes The National Standards implementing Eurocodes will comprise the full text of the Eurocode (including any annexes), as published by CEN, which may be preceded by a National title page and National foreword, and may be followed by a National annex. The National annex may only contain information on those parameters which are left open in the Eurocode for national choice, known as Nationally Determined Parameters, to be used for the design of buildings and civil engineering works to be constructed in the country concerned, I.e.: - values and/or classes where alternatives are given in the Eurocode; - values to be used where a symbol only is given in the Eurocode; country specific data (geographical, climatic, etc.), e.g. snow map; 2 According to Art. 3.3 of the CPD, the essential requirements (ERs) shall be given concrete form in interpretative documents for the creation of the necessary links between the essential requirements and the mandates for harmonised ENs and ETAGs/ETAs. 3 According to Art. 12 of the CPD the interpretative documents shall: give concrete form to the essential requirements by harmonising the terminology and the technical bases and indicating classes or levels for each requirement where necessary; indicate methods of correlating these classes or levels of requirement with the technical specifications, e.g. methods of calculation and of proof, technical rules for project design, etc. ; serve as a reference for the establishment of harmonised standards and guidelines for European technical approvals. The Eurocodes, de facto, playa similar role in the field of the ER 1 and a part of ER 2. 8 BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995-1-1:2004+A1:2008 (E) the procedure to be used where alternative procedures are given in the Eurocode; - decisions on the application of informative annexes; - references to non-contradictory complementary information to assist the user to apply the Eurocode. links between Eurocodes and harmonised technical specifications (ENs and ETAs) for products There is a need for consistency between the harmonised technical specifications for construction products and the technical rules for works4 . Furthermore, all the information accompanying the CE Marking of the construction products which refer to Eurocodes shall clearly mention which Nationally Determined Parameters have been taken into account. Additional information specific to EN 1995-1-1 EN 1995 describes the Principles and requirements for safety, serviceability and durability of timber structures. It is based on the limit state concept used in conjunction with a partial factor method. For the design of new structures. EN 1995 is intended to be used, for direct application, together with EN 1990:2002 and relevant Parts of EN 1991. Numerical values for partial factors and other reliability parameters are recommended as basic values that provide an acceptable level of reliability. They have been selected assuming that an appropriate level of workmanship and of quality management applies. When EN 1995-1-1 is used as a base document by other CENtTCs the same values need to be taken. National annex for EN 1995-1-1 This standard gives alternative procedures, values and recommendations with notes indicating where national choices may have to be made. Therefore the National Standard implementing EN 1995-1-1 should have a National annex containing all Nationally Determined Parameters to be used for the design of buildings and civil engineering works to be constructed in the relevant country. National choice is allowed in EN 1995-1-1 through clauses: 2.3.1.2(2)P 2.3.1.3(1 )P 2.4.1(1)P 6.1.7(2) 6.4.3(8) 7.2(2) 7.3.3(2) 8.3.1.2(4) 8.3.1.2(7) 9.2.4.1 (7) 9.2.5.3(1) 10.9.2(3) 10.9.2(4 ) Assignment of loads to load-duration classes; Assignment of structures to service classes; Partial factors for material properties; Shear; Double tapered, curved and pitched cambered beams; Limiting values for deflections; Limiting values for vibrations; Nailed timber-to-timber connections: Rules for nails in end grain; Nailed timber-to-timber connections: Species sensitive to splitting; Design method for wall diaphragms; Bracing modification factors for beam or truss systems; Erection of trusses with punched metal plate fasteners: Maximum bow; Erection of trusses with punched metal plate fasteners: Maximum deviation.

(2)P The supplementary provisions for timber structures given in this section shall also be applied. (3) The basic requirements of EN 1990:2002 section 2 are deemed to be satisfied for timber structures when limit state design, in conjunction with the partial factor method using EN 1990:2002 and EN 1991 for actions and their combinations and EN 1995 for resistances, rules for serviceability and durability, is applied. 2.1.2 Reliability management (1) When different levels of reliability are required, these levels should be preferably achieved by an appropriate choice of quality management in design and execution, according to EN 1990:2002 Annex C. 2.1.3 Design working life and durability ~ (1) EN 1990:2002 clauses 2.3 and 2.4 apply. ~ 2.2 Principles of limit state design 2.2.1 General (1)P The design models for the different limit states shall, as appropriate, take into account the following: - different material properties (e.g. strength and stiffness); - different time-dependent behaviour of the materials (duration of load, creep); - different climatic conditions (temperature, moisture variations); different design situations (stages of construction, change of support conditions). 2.2.2 Ultimate limit states (1)P The analysis of structures shall be carried out using the following values for stiffness properties: for a first order linear elastic analysis of a structure, whose distribution of internal forces is not affected by the stiffness distribution within the structure (eg. all members have the same time-dependent properties), mean values shall be used; - for a first order linear elastic analysis of a structure, whose distribution of internal forces is affected by the stiffness distribution within the structure (eg. composite members containing materials having different time-dependent properties), final mean values adjusted to the load component causing the largest stress in relation to strength shall be used; for a second order linear elastic analysis of a structure, design values, not adjusted for duration of load, shall be used. NOTE 1: For final mean values adjusted to the duration of load, see 2.3.2.2(2). NOTE 2: For design values of stiffness properties, see 2.4.1 (2)P. (2) The slip modulus of a connection for the ultimate limit state, Ku, should be taken as: 19 BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995-1-1 :2004+A1 :2008 (E) ~ where Kser is the slip modulus, see 7.1 (1). ~ 2.2.3 Serviceability limit states (2.1 ) (1)P The deformation of a structure which results from the effects of actions (such as axial and shear forces, bending moments and joint slip) and from moisture shall remain within appropriate limits, having regard to the possibility of damage to surfacing materials, ceilings, floors, partitions and finishes, and to the functional needs as well as any appearance requirements. (2) The instantaneous deformation, ltinst. see figure 7.1, should be calculated for the characteristic combination of actions, see EN 1990, clause 6.5.3(2) a), using mean values of the appropriate moduli of elasticity, shear moduli and slip moduli. (3) The final deformation, Ufin, see figure 7.1, should be calculated for the quasi-permanent combination of actions, see EN 1990, clause 6.5.3(2) c). (4) If the structure consists of members or components having different creep behaviour, the final deformation should be calculated using final mean values of the appropriate moduli of elasticity, shear moduli and slip moduli, according to 2.3.2.2(1). (5) For structures consisting of members, components and connections with the same creep behaviour and under the assumption of a linear relationship between the actions and the corresponding deformations, as a simplification of 2.2.3(3), the final deformation, Ufjn, may be taken as: where: Ufin,G = (1+ for a permanent action, G for the leading variable action, 0 1 = uinst,Q,i (V'O,i + V'2,jkdef ) for accompanying variable actions, OJ (i> 1) lI inst,G' Uinst,Q,1 , Uinst,Q,i are the instantaneous deformations for action 0 1, OJ respectively; V'2,1, V'2,j are the factors for the quasi-permanent value of variable actions; are the factors for the combination value of variable actions; (2.2) (2.3) (2.4) (2.5) V'o,j kdef is given in table 3.2 for timber and wood-based materials, and in 2.3.2.2 (3) and 2.3.2.2 (4) for connections. When expressions (2.3) to (2.5) are used, the V'2 factors should be omitted from expressions (6.16a) and (6.16b) of EN1990:2002. Note: In most cases, it will be appropriate to apply the simplified method. (6) For serviceability limit states with respect to vibrations, mean values of the appropriate stiffness moduli should be used. 20 BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995-1-1:2004+A1:2008 (E) 2.3 Basic variables 2.3.1 Actions and environmental influences 2.3.1.1 General (1) Actions to be used in design may be obtained from the relevant parts of EN 1991.

The models shall be sufficiently precise to predict the structural behaviour, commensurate with the standard of workmanship likely to be achieved, and with the reliability of the information on which the design is based. (2) The global structural behaviour should be assessed by calculating the action effects with a linear material model (elastic behaviour). (3) For structures able to redistribute the internal forces via connections of adequate ductility, elastic-plastic methods may be used for the calculation of the internal forces in the members. (4)P The model for the calculation of internal forces in the structure or in part of it shall take into account the effects of deformations of the connections. (5) In general, the influence of deformations in the connections should be taken into account through their stiffness (rotational or translational for instance) or through prescribed slip values as a function of the load level in the connection. 5.2 Members (1)P The following shall be taken into account by the structural analysis: - deviations from straightness; - inhomogeneities of the material. NOTE: Deviations from straightness and inhomogeneities are taken into account implicitly by the design methods given in this standard. (2)P Reductions in the cross-sectional area shall be taken into account in the member strength verification. (3) Reductions in the cross-sectional area may be ignored for the following cases: - nails and screws with a diameter of 6 mm or less, driven without pre-drilling; - holes in the compression area of members, if the holes are filled with a material of higher stiffness than the wood. (4) When assessing the effective cross-section at a joint with multiple fasteners, all holes within a distance of half the minimum fastener spacing measured parallel to the grain from a given cross-section should be considered as occurring at that cross-section. 5.3 Connections (1)P The load-carrying-capacity of the connections shall be verified taking into account the forces and the moments between the members determined by the global structural analysis. (2)P The deformation of the connection shall be compatible with that assumed in the global analysis. (3)P The analysis of a connection shall take into account the behaviour of all the elements which constitute the connection. 31 BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995-1-1 :2004+A1 :2008 (E) 5.4 Assemblies 5.4.1 General (1)P The analysis of structures shall be carried out using static models which consider to an acceptable level of accuracy the behaviour of the structure and of the supports. (2) The analysis should be performed by frame models in accordance with 5.4.2 or by a simplified analysis in accordance with 5.4.3 for trusses with punched metal plate fasteners. (3) Second order analysis of plane frames or arches should be performed in accordance with 5.4.4. 5.4.2 Frame structures (1)P Frame structures shall be analysed such that the deformations of the members and joints, the influence of support eccentricities and the stiffness of the supporting structure are taken into account in the determination of the member forces and moments, see Figure 5.1 for definitions of structure configurations and model elements. (2) Key: (1) System line (2) Support (3) Bay (4) External member (5) Internal member (6) Fictitious beam element Figure 5.1 - Examples of frame analysis model elements (2)P In a frame analysis, the system lines for all members shall lie within the member profile. For the main members, e.g. the external members of a truss, the system lines shall coincide with the member centre-line. (3)P If the system lines for internal members do not coincide with the centre lines, the influence of the eccentricity shall be taken into account in the strength verification of these members. (4) Fictitious beam elements and spring elements may be used to model eccentric connections or supports. The orientation of fictitious beam elements and the location of the spring elements should coincide as closely as possible with the actual joint configuration. (5) In a first order linear elastic analysis, the effect of initial deformations and induced deflections may be disregarded if taken into account by the strength verification of the member. 32 BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995-1-1:2004+A1:2008 (E) (6) The frame analysis should be carried out using the appropriate values of member stiffness defined in 2.2.2. Fictitious beam elements should be assumed to have a stiffness corresponding to that of the actual connections. (7) Connections may be assumed to be rotationally stiff, if their deformation has no significant effect upon the distribution of member forces and moments. Otherwise, connections may be generally assumed to be rotationally pinned. (8) Translational slip at the joints may be disregarded for the strength verification unless it significantly affects the distribution of internal forces and moments. (9) Splice connections used in lattice structures may be modelled as rotationally stiff if the actual rotation under load would have no significant effect upon member forces. This requirement is fulfilled if one of the following conditions is satisfied: The splice connection has a load-carrying capacity which corresponds to at least 1,5 times the combination of applied force and moment The splice connection has a load-carrying capacity which corresponds to at least the combination of applied force and moment, provided that the timber members are not subject to bending stresses which are greater than 0,3 times the member bending strength, and the assembly would be stable if all such connections acted as pins. 5.4.3 Simplified analysis of trusses with punched metal plate fasteners (1) A simplified analysis of fully triangulated trusses should comply with the following conditions: there are no re-entrant angles in the external profile; the bearing width is situated within the length a1, and the distance G2 in Figure 5.2 is not greater than G1/3 or 100 mm, whichever is the greater; the truss height is greater than 0,15 times the span and 10 times the maximum external member depth. (2) The axial forces in the members should be determined on the basis that every node is pin- jointed. (3) The bending moments in single-bay members should be determined on the basis that the end nodes are pin-jointed. Bending moments in members that are continuous over several bays should be determined on the basis that the member is a beam with a simple support at each node. The effect of deflection at the nodes and partial fixity at the connections should be taken into account by a reduction of 10 % of the moments at the inner supports of the member. The inner support moments should be used to calculate the span bending moments. 33 BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995-1-1 :2004+A1 :2008 (E) Figure 5.2 Geometry of support 5.4.4 Plane frames and arches (1)P The requirements of 5.2 apply. The effects of induced deflection on internal forces and moments shall be taken into account. (2) The effects of induced deflection on internal forces and moments may be taken into account by carrying out a second order linear analysis with the following assumptions: the imperfect shape of the structure should be assumed to correspond to an initial deformation which is found by applying an angle ¢ of inclination to the structure or relevant parts, together with an initial sinusoidal curvature between the nodes of the structure corresponding to a maximum eccentricity e. - the value of ¢ in radians should as a minimum be taken as ¢ 0,005 ¢ = 0,005 ..)5/ h for h 5 m for h > 5 m where h is the height of the structure or the length of the member, in m. - the value of e should as a minimum be taken as: e = O,0025e Examples of assumed initial deviations in the geometry and the definition of tare given in Figure 5.3. 34 (5.1 ) (5.2) a) b) 0,0025.( 0,0025 h '\" c) BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995-1-1 :2004+A 1 :2008 (E) ,..+\"\"'~-.\"-\"-\" O,0025l~ Figure 5.3 - Examples of assumed initial deviations in the geometry for a frame (a), corresponding to a symmetrical load (b) and non-symmetrical load (c) 35 BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995·1 ~1 :2004+A 1 :2008 (E) Section 6 Ultimate limit states 6.1 Design of cross-sections subjected to stress in one principal direction 6.1.1 General (1) Clause 6.1 applies to straight solid timber, glued laminated timber or wood·based structural products of constant cross-section, whose grain runs essentially parallel to the length of the member.

(2)P The wall shall be adequately restrained to avoid overturning and sliding. (3)P Wall diaphragms deemed to provide resistance to racking shall be stiffened in-plane by board materials, diagonal bracing or moment connections. (4)P The racking resistance of a wall shall be determined either by test according to EN 594 or by calculations, employing appropriate analytical methods or design models. (5)P The design of wall diaphragms shall take account of both the material construction and geometric make-up of the wall under consideration. (6)P The response of wall diaphragms to actions shall be assessed to ensure the construction remains within appropriate serviceability limits. (7) For wall diaphragms two alternative simplified methods of calculation are given in 9.2.4.2 and 9.2.4.3. NOTE: The recommended procedure is method A given in 9.2.4.2. National choice may be given in the National annex. 9.2.4.2 Simplified analysis of wall diaphragms - Method A (1) The simplified method given in this subclause should only be applied to wall diaphragms with a tie-down at their end, that is the vertical member at the end is directly connected to the construction below. (2) The design load-carrying capacity Fv,Rd (the design racking resistance) under a force Fv,Ed acting at the top of a cantilevered panel secured against uplift (by vertical actions or by anchoring) should be determined using the following simplified method of analysis for walls made up of one or more panels, where each wall panel consists of a sheet fixed to one side of a timber frame, provided that: - the spacing of fasteners is constant along the perimeter of every sheet; - the width of each sheet is at least h14. (3) For a wall made up of several wall panels, the design racking load-carrying capacity of a wall should be calculated from Fv,Rd = LFi,\\',Rd (9.20) 15> where Fi,v,Rd is the design racking load-carrying capacity of the wall panel in accordance with 9.2.4.2(4) and 9.2.4.2(5). ®l (4) The design racking load-carrying capacity of each wall panel, Fj,v.Rd, against a force Fj,v,Ed according to Figure 9.5 should be calculated from (9.21 ) where: Ff.Rd is the lateral design capacity of an individual fastener; hi is the wall panel width; 94 BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995-1-1 :2004+A1 :2008 (E) s is the fastener spacing. and for hi :2: bo c =l~ I ~ for bj < bo (9.22) bo where: bo hl2 h is the height of the wall. (5) For fasteners along the edges of an individual sheet, the design lateral load-carrying capacity should be increased by a factor of 1,2 over the corresponding values given in Section 8. In determining the fastener spacing in accordance with the requirements of Section 8, the edges should be assumed to be unloaded. a) +- b) Figure 9.5 - Forces acting on: a) wall panel; b) framing; c) sheet .,. .,. + + t + -+ + t -+ ... ...... .............. +-+- ..

(7) For wall panels with sheets on both sides the following rules apply: if the sheets and fasteners are of the same type and dimension then the total racking load- carrying capacity of the wall should be taken as the sum of the racking load-carrying capacities of the individual sides if different types of sheets are used, 75 % of the racking load-carrying capacity of the weaker side may, unless some other value is shown to be valid, be taken into consideration if fasteners with similar slip moduli are used. In other cases not more than 50 % should be taken into consideration. (8) The external forces and according to Figure 9.5 should be determined from 95 BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995-1-1:2004+A1:2008 (E) Pi,c,Ed Fi,v,Ed h b· I where h is the height of the wall. (9.23) (9) These forces can either be transmitted to the sheets in the adjacent wall panel or transmitted to the construction situated above or below. When tensile forces are transmitted to the construction situated below, the panel should be anchored by stiff fasteners. Buckling of wall studs should be checked in accordance with 6.3.2. Where the ends of vertical members bear on horizontal framing members, the compression perpendicular to the grain stresses in the horizontal members should be assessed according to 6.1.5. (10) The external forces which arise in wall panels containing door or window openings and in wall panels of smaller width, see Figure 9.6, can similarly be transmitted to the construction situated above or below.

(12) In order that the centre stud may be considered to constitute a support for a sheet, the spacing of fasteners in the centre stud should not be greater than twice the spacing of the fasteners along the edges of the sheet. (13) Where each panel consists of a prefabricated wall element, the transfer of shear forces between the separate wall elements should be verified. (14) In contact areas between vertical studs and horizontal timber members, compression stresses perpendicular to grain should be verified in the timber members. 96 BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995-1-1 :2004+A1 :2008 (E) 9.2.4.3 Simplified analysis of wall diaphragms - Method B 9.2.4.3.1 Construction of walls and panels to meet the requirements of the simplified analysis (1) A wall assembly (see Figure 9.7) is comprised of one or more walls with each wall formed from one or more panels, the panels being made from sheets of wood-based panel products, such as those described in 3.5, fastened to a timber frame.

The fastening of the sheets to the timber frame should be by either nails or screws and the fasteners should be equally spaced around the perimeter of the sheet. Fasteners within the perimeter of a sheet should be spaced at not more than twice the perimeter fastener spacing. (3) Where an opening is formed in a panel, the lengths of panel on each side of the opening should be considered as separate panels. (4) Where panels are combined to form a wall: - the tops of individual panels should be linked by a member or construction across the panel joints; - the required vertical connection strength between two panels should be evaluated but should have a design strength of at least 2,5 kN/m; - the panels when joined together to form a wall should be able to resist overturning and sliding forces by either anchorage to the supporting structure or the permanent actions applied to the wall or a combination of both effects. 97 BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995-1-1:2004+A1:2008 (E) 9.2.4.3.2 Design procedure (1) The in-plane design shear (racking) strength F v.Rd against a force F v.Ed acting at the top of a cantilevered wall that is secured against uplift and sliding by vertical actions and/or anchorage, should be determined using the following simplified method for the wall construction defined in 9.2.4.3.1. (2) For a wall assembly made up of several walls, the design racking strength of the wall assembly F v.Rd should be calculated from = \"\" F Rd \"'-' I,V, where: Fi.v,Rd is the design racking strength of a wall in accordance with (3) below. (3) The design racking strength of a wall i, FLv,Rd, should be calculated from b Pi,v.Rd = -----'--_I kd kj,q ks kn So where: FCRd is the lateral design capacity of an individual fastener; bi is the wall length, in m; ~ So is the basic fastener spacing, in m, see (4) below; kd is the dimension factor for the wall, see (4) below; ®J kj •q is the uniformly distributed load factor for wall i, see (4) below; k, is the fastener spacing factor, see (4) below; kn is the sheatt\"ling material factor, see (4) below.

(a) (b) (9.29) (9.30) (5) The equivalent vertical load, qi, used to calculate ki,q should be determined using only permanent actions and any net effects of wind together with the equivalent actions arising from concentrated forces, including anchorage forces, acting on the panel. For the purposes of calculating ki,q, concentrated vertical forces should be converted into an equivalent uniformly distributed load on the assumption that the wall is a rigid body e.g. for the load Fi,vertEd acting on the wall as shown in Figure 9.8 (9.31) where: a is the horizontal distance from the force Fto the leeward corner of the wall; b is the length of the wall. a Figure 9.8 - Determination of equivalent vertical action qi and reaction forces from vertical and horizontal actions 99 BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995-1-1:2004+A1:2008 (E) (6) The external forces and Fj,t,Ed (see Figure 9.8) from the horizontal action Fj,v,Ed on wall i should be determined from h (9.32) where h is the height of the wall. These external forces can be transmitted to either the adjacent panel through the vertical panel- to-panel connection or to the construction above or below the wall. When tensile forces are transmitted to the construction below, the panel should be anchored with stiff fasteners. Compression forces in the vertical members should be checked for buckling in accordance with 6.3.2. Where the ends of vertical members bear on horizontal framing members, the compression perpendicular to the grain stresses in the horizontal members should be assessed according to 6.1.5. (7) The buckling of the sheets under the action of shear force may be disregarded provided 5100 where: bne! is the clear distance between vertical members of the timber frame; is the thickness of the sheathing. 9.2.5 Bracing 9.2.5.1 General (9.33) (1)P Structures which are not otherwise adequately stiff shall be braced to prevent instability or excessive deflection. (2)P The stress caused by geometrical and structural imperfections, and by induced deflections (including the contribution of any joint slip) shall be taken into account. (3)P The bracing forces shall be determined on the basis of the most unfavourable combination of structural imperfections and induced deflections. 9.2.5.2 Single members in compression (1) For single elements in compression, requiring lateral support at intervals a (see Figure 9.9), the initial deviations from straightness between supports should be within a/SOO for glued laminated or LVL members, and a/300 for other members. (2) Each intermediate support should have a minimum spring stiffness C C k Nd s a where: ks is a modification factor; Nd is the mean design compressive force in the element; a is the bay length (see Figure 9.9). 100 (9.34) BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995-1-1 :2004+A 1 :2008 (E) NOTE: For ks, see note in 9.2.5.3(1) (3) The design stabilizing force at each support should be taken as: for solid timber (9.35) for glued laminated timberandLVL where kfl and are modification factors.

The limitations on bow in most strength grading rules are inadequate for the selection of material for these members and particular attention should therefore be paid to their straightness. (2) Timber and wood-based components and structural elements should not be unnecessarily exposed to climatic conditions more severe than those expected in the finished structure. (3) Before being used in construction, timber should be dried as near as practicable to the moisture content appropriate to its climatic condition in the completed structure. If the effects of any shrinkage are not considered important, or if parts that are unacceptably damaged are replaced, higher moisture contents may be accepted during erection provided that it is ensured that the timber can dry to the desired moisture content. 10.3 Glued joints (1) Where bond strength is a requirement for ultimate limit state design, the manufacture of glued joints should be subject to quality control, to ensure that the reliability and quality of the joint is in accordance with the technical specification. (2) The adhesive manufacturer's recommendations with respect to mixing, environmental conditions for application and curing, moisture content of members and all factors relevant to the proper use of the adhesive should be followed. (3) For adhesives which require a conditioning period after initial set, before attaining full strength, the application of load to the joint should be restricted for the necessary time. 10.4 Connections with mechanical fasteners 10.4.1 General (1)P Wane, splits, knots or other defects shall be limited in the region of the connection such that the load-carrying capacity of the connection is not reduced. 10.4.2 Nails (1) Unless otherwise specified, nails should be driven in at right angles to the grain and to such depth that the surfaces of the nail heads are flush with the timber surface. (2) Unless otherwise specified, slant nailing should be carried out in accordance with Figure 8.8(b). (3) The diameter of pre-drilled holes should not exceed 0,8d, where d is the nail diameter. 10.4.3 Bolts and washers (1) Bolt holes in timber should have a diameter not more than 1 mm larger than the bolt. Bolt 103 BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995-1-1 :2004+A 1 :2008 (E) holes in steel plates should have a diameter not more than 2 mm or 0,1 d (whichever is the greater) larger than the bolt diameter d. (2) Washers with a side length or a diameter of at least 3d and a thickness of at least 0,3d should be used under the head and nut. Washers should have a full bearing area. (3) Bolts and lag screws should be tightened so that the members fit closely, and they should be re-tightened if necessary when the timber has reached equilibrium moisture content to ensure that the load-carrying capacity and stiffness of the structure is maintained. (4) The minimum diameter requirements given in Table 10.1 apply to bolts used with timber connectors, where: de is the connector diameter, in mm; d is the bolt diameter, in mm d l is the diameter of centre hole of connector. Table 10.1 - Requirements for diameters of bolts used with timber connectors Type of d d connector de minimum maximum EN 912 mm mm mm A1-A6 :::;; 130 12 24 A1, A4, A6 > 130 0,1 de 24 B dl -1 d l 10.4.4 Dowels (1) The minirnum dowel diameter should be 6 mm. The tolerances on the dowel diameter should be - 01+0,1 mm. Pre-bored holes in the timber members should have a diameter not greater than the dowel. 15) 10.4.5 Screws (1) For pre-drilling screws in softwoods with a smooth shank diameter d ~ 6 mm, pre-drilling is not required. For all screws in hardwoods and for pre-drilling screws in softwoods with a diameter d> 6 mm, pre-drilling is required, with the following requirements: The lead hole for the shank should have the same diameter as the shank and the same depth as the length of the shank - The lead hole for the threaded portion should have a diameter of approximately 70 % of the shank diameter. (2) For timber densities greater than 500 kg/m 3 , the pre-drilling diameter should be determined by tests. (3)P Where pre-drilling is applied to selfdrilling screws, the lead hole diameter shall not be greater than the inner thread diameter dl' ~ 10.5 Assembly (1) The structure should be assembled in such a way that over-stressing of its members or connections is avoided. Members which are warped, split or badly fitting at the joints should be replaced. 104 BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995-1-1 :2004+A 1 :2008 (E) 10.6 Transportation and erection (1) The over-stressing of members during storage, transportation or erection should be avoided. If the structure is loaded or supported in a different manner during construction than in the finished building the temporary condition should be considered as a relevant load case, including any possible dynamic actions. In the case of structural framework, e.g. framed arches, portal frames, special care should be taken to avoid distortion during hoisting from the horizontal to the vertical position. 10.7 Control (1) It is assumed that a control plan comprises: - production and workmanship control off and on site; - control after completion of the structure. NOTE 1: The control of the construction is assumed to include: preliminary tests, e.g. tests for suitability of materials and production methods; checking of materials and their identification e.g.: - for wood and wood-based materials: species, grade, marking, treatments and moisture content; for glued constructions: adhesive type, production process, glue-line quality; for fasteners: type, corrosive protection; - transport, site storage and handling of materials; - checking of correct dimensions and geometry; - checking of assembly and erection; - checking of structural details, e.g.: number of nails, bolts etc.; sizes of holes, correct pre-drilling; spacings and distances to end and edge of members; splitting; final checking of the result of the production process, e.g. by visual inspection or proof loading. NOTE 2: A control program is assumed to specify the control measures (inspection maintenance) to be carried out in service where long-term compliance with the basic assumptions for the project is not adequately ensured. NOTE 3: All the information required for the use in service and the maintenance of a structure is assumed to be made available to the person or authority who undertakes responsibility for the finished structure. 10.8 Special rules for diaphragm structures 10.8.1 Floor and roof diaphragms (1) The simplified method of analysis given in 9.2.3.2 assumes that sheathing panels not supported by joists or rafters are connected to each other e.g. by means of battens as shown in Figure 10.1. Nails other than smooth nails, as defined in EN 14592, or screws should be used, with a maximum spacing along the edges of the sheathing panels of 150 mm. Elsewhere the maximum spacing should be 300 mm. 105 BS EN 1995-1-1:2004+Al:2008 EN 1995-1-1 :2004+A 1 :2008 (E) A T T (1 ) A Key: (1) Batten slant nailed to joist or rafter (2) Batten (3) Sheathing nailed to batten (3) (2) Figure 10.1 - Example of connection of panels not supported by a joist or a rafter 10.8.2 Wall diaphragms (1) The simplified methods of analysis given in 9.2.4.2 and 9.2.4.3 assume that panel fixings have a maximum fastener spacing along the edges of 150 mm for nails, and 200 mm for screws.

However, if members which have distorted during the period between fabrication and erection can be straightened without damage to the timber or the joints and maintained straight, the truss may be considered satisfactory for use. (3) The maximum bow Gbow in any truss member after erection should be limited. Provided that it is adequately secured in the completed roof to prevent the bow from increasing, the permitted value of the maximum bow should be taken as Gbow.perm' Note: The recommended range of abOW.pCITIl is 10 to 50 mm. The National choice may be given in the National annex. (4) The maximum deviation Gdev of a truss from true vertical alignment after erection should be limited.

B.1.2 Assumptions (1) The design method is based on the theory of linear elasticity and the following assumptions: the beams are simply supported with a spane. For continuous beams the expressions may be used withe equal to 0,8 of the relevant span and for cantilevered beams with e equal to twice the cantilever length the individual parts (of wood, wood-based panels) are either full length or made with glued end joints - the individual parts are connected to each other by mechanical fasteners with a slip modulus K - the spacing s between the fasteners is constant or varies uniformly according to the shear force between Smin and Smax, with .::: 4 Smin the load is acting in the z-direction giving a moment M = lvl(x) varying sinusoidally or parabolically and a shear force V V(.\\:).
