The tower is 21 meters tall, and has a 10-meter diameter. The stage itself is 6 x 8 meters. The stage generates its energy through solar panels, LSC panels in the tower, a wind turbine located at the top, and a hydrogen generator which is places next to the stages. The energy is stored in the battery - located at the base of the stage. The GEM project was started in 2018. In 2019, the GEM- Tower was designed and first placed at Pukkelpop Festival (BE). After adding a stage and a hydrogen generator, in 2021 the GEM-Tower became GEM-Stage. In summer 2021, the GEM-Stage will tour several European countries. The stage can provide the amount power that is needed The stage was designed together with the festival organisations There are over 300 hinges in the stage; 584 bolts and nuts are required; The 700 kg vertical wind turbine is placed at a height of 18 meters; 20m² of coloured solar panels (LSC panels) is incorporated in the tower; The stage does not have to be anchored; 3.2 m³ of concrete has been used as a counterweight as well An estimated 100 people contributed to the realisation of the first The 45 kWh GEM battery can charge an iPhone up to 3.500 times GEM-Stage fun facts for a full live show of a DJ, Singer-songwriter or band; within the GEM project; as the weight of the battery; GEM-tower (2018-2020); – that’s 9,5 years worth of charging the phone on a daily base. Height: 2 1 m; Base diameter: 1 0 m; Stage: 6 x 8 meters; Wind turbine: Darrieus–Savonius Vertical Axis, 3 kW; Battery: 2 5 VRLA cells, net useable capacity 4 5 kWh; PV panels: 3 6 Semi Flexible, PERC cells, 4 kW; Hydrogen generator: 2 0 kW; Maximum power output 3 0 kVA / 2 4 kW.
