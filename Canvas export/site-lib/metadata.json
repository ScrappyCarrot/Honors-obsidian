Temporary Structure ClassificationA \"temporary structure\" is defined as a structure with a maintenance period of no more than 15 years at the same location, making your 3-year plan compliant with this definition.• General Rules: The rules of Chapter 3 (Existing Structures) generally apply to the construction of a temporary structure, unless otherwise specified in Sections 4.2 to 4.7 (New Constructions),. The underlying assumption for structural and health requirements is that satisfying the rules for existing structures (Sections 3.2 to 3.7) is sufficient.• Specific Requirements (Chapter 4): Key rules from Chapter 4 that specifically apply to temporary structures include provisions related to:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◦ Escape Routes and Fire Assistance: Articles 4.65 to 4.71 (course of escape routes) and Articles 4.84 and 4.85 (fire brigade lift/aid post) apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◦ Ventilation and Flue Gas: The requirements for ventilation/flushing facility capacity (Articles 4.131 and 4.132) and rules regarding flue gas discharge/combustion air supply (Articles 4.135 to 4.141) apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◦ Sustainability (Thermal): Articles 4.152 (thermal resistance), 4.153 (heat transfer coefficient), and 4.154 (air volume flow) apply, generally setting the minimum requirements at values specified in Table 4.148B,.B. Relocation RegulationsThe relocation of a temporary structure is considered the displacement of an existing structure,.• Rules for Displacement: When relocating an existing structure in an unchanged composition, the structure must comply with the rules of Chapter 3 (Existing Structures),. For a temporary structure, this rule remains applicable after relocation,.\nStructural and Geotechnical Requirements\nThe structure's design must comply with the general design principles found in the Eurocodes, which inform the Bbl regulations.A. Structural Safety and Load CombinationsAll structures must be designed to withstand all forces during use and execution, and to prevent progressive collapse (disproportionate damage in the event of an accident),,.• Verification Basis: Verification of the ultimate limit state (ULS) is based on Eurocode (EN 1990),,,,.• Load Combinations: Structural non-failure verification involves using fundamental load combinations (normal use conditions),, and exceptional load combinations (e.g., resulting from fire, impact, or explosion),,.B. Optimal Foundations (Geotechnical Requirements)While the sources do not specify the single \"optimal\" foundation type (which depends on local soil conditions and logistics), they mandate the methodology for selecting suitable foundations and verifying their performance.• Geotechnical Design: Design must account for geotechnical aspects (soil, rock, groundwater) in accordance with Eurocode 7 (EN 1997),. Geotechnical investigations are required to establish the ground profile and strength/deformation properties.• Investigation Depth: The investigation depth must extend to all strata that will affect the project. For piles, this depth is typically down to a level below the lowest point of the pile base,.• Bearing Resistance and Settlement: The bearing resistance and settlement of spread foundations may be derived using:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◦ Semi-empirical or analytical methods from Cone Penetration Test (CPT) results.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◦ Standard Penetration Test (SPT) or Dynamic Probing (DP) results in coarse soil, provided local experience or reliable correlations are used,Ballasted supported foundationThis type of foundation relies on weight to provide resistance against uplift and lateral forces.\n<br>Ballasted systems (non penetrating)- this type of foundation relies solely on weight to resist against forces. The most common materials are concrete blocks, like the system used in <a data-href=\"Gem-Stage tower (floor)\" href=\"research/gem-stage-tower-(floor).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gem-Stage tower (floor)</a>. This is the most common method and probably the most cost efficient. Steel baskets filled with agregate, and containers filled with water/concerte are also used. These are best used when penetration is prohibited or impractical (this might be relevant to us depending on what the municipality tells us the construction sites will be).\nFailure modes-Ground failure, since this foundation doesn't penetrate the ground, it relies on distributing the force over weak soil like mud or peat.\nConcrete based footings- More traditional approach, this casts or drills piles into the ground for heavy load bearing. This might be a good option provided we can remove the foundation and reuse it again (if the loads call for such heavy foundation elements)\nSubmerged concrete blocks with ballast above. We could have big concrete blocks that are underground at around -1.000mm. The primary failure mode of this method would be shear failure of the slab. This, however can be mitigated by increasing the number of contact points to the ground thus decreasing the load on each one, adding rebar and changing dimensions.<br>\n<a href=\".?query=tag:Research\" class=\"tag colored-tag-research is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Research\">#Research</a><br>\n<a href=\".?query=tag:Foundation\" class=\"tag colored-tag-foundation is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Foundation\">#Foundation</a>\nBallast Supported Foundations<br>Look into starwin and their developed method (still this might need submerging by -0.500mm<img src=\"media/images/img-15-12-2025-120629098.png\" draggable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">IMG-15-12-2025-120629098.png<img src=\"media/images/img-15-12-2025-120548680.png\" draggable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">IMG-15-12-2025-120548680.png<img src=\"media/images/img-15-12-2025-120418416.png\" draggable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">IMG-15-12-2025-120418416.png<img src=\"media/images/pasted-image-20251214215500.png\" draggable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">Pasted image 20251214215500.png<img src=\"media/images/gemini_generated_image_hbccjnhbccjnhbcc.png\" draggable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">Gemini_Generated_Image_hbccjnhbccjnhbcc.png\nRules for temporary structures are less strict as we can use the existing building protocols instead of the new construction ones\nFoundations should be made with precast concrete slabs instead of pouring piles (See Floor project)\nLoad combinations along with 3D wind patterns have to be considered. ( less of an issue if we go for the small wildlife variant as the structures are much smaller)\nDynamics of users have to be taken into account&gt; steel doesn't dampen vibrations well and it can cause resonance which weakens the structure\nPossible limitation of non penetrating systems is that I have mainly found them to be implemented in solar pannel arrays\nOslo Opera House\nTU Delft Library\nEwha womans university<br>\n<a data-href=\"4.
