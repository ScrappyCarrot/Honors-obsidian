The provided document, titled "History of Urbanism and Architecture Book 1," offers a comprehensive overview of the history of urbanism and architecture, focusing primarily on the Ancient Greco-Roman city and the subsequent urban developments of the Middle Ages. The text delves into the defining characteristics, political significance, architectural typologies, and urban planning philosophies of these periods.The Ancient Greco-Roman City  
  
The document begins by contrasting the nature of ancient Greek and Roman cities with a common misconception of their permanence. Sociologist Rodney Stark is cited as arguing that the impressive ruins of classical cities present an "illusion" of eternity, when in reality, they were "transformation cities," constantly changing due to decay and reconstruction from natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, or fires. Fortier categorized the Ancient Greco-Roman city as a "transformation city" due to this constant change and idiosyncratic rebuilding. Rome, in particular, is referred to as an "accumulation city" because its transformation was more drastic, resulting in a conglomeration of monumental artifacts with less cohesion. This transformation also affected the population, with cities often becoming depopulated and then re-inhabited with a dramatically changing ethnic makeup.  
  
The political significance of these cities is highlighted, emphasizing that their architecture and urban planning cannot be understood without their societal dimension. The Greek city, especially Athens, is associated with the _polis_, or city-state, as an autonomous administrative entity and the origin of democracy, derived from _demos_ (people). The political arrangement of incorporating surrounding villages into the polis was known as _synoecism_ (living together in one house). Conversely, Rome started as a city of different tribes, where later emperors exercised power and built grandiose structures to keep the people content with 'bread and games.'Periodization  
  
The development of Greek civilization is commonly divided into three periods: the Archaic period (c. 776-500 BC), the sophisticated Classical period (c. 500-323 BC), and the Hellenistic period (323-146 BC). These followed the prehistory of Greek civilization, which included the Minoan civilization in Crete (c. 3000-1400 BC) and the Mycenaean civilization on the mainland (c. 1600-1100 BC). Geographically, the Minoan culture originated in Crete, leading some to prefer the term "Aegean complex" instead of Greece, as the same material way of life was found across the Greek mainland, islands, and the west coast of Asia Minor.  
  
The Hellenistic period began with the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC. In the preceding decades of the Classical period, Greek city-states lost independence until Philip II of Macedon unified the region in 338 BC, founding the Greco-Macedonian Empire. Alexander the Great continued to spread Greek culture widely. Upon his death, the empire was divided into the four Diadochi Kingdoms, which were gradually conquered by the Romans, who appropriated and adapted Greek culture. The Hellenistic period is thus viewed as an interim period where Greek city-states were no longer independent, but the Roman Empire had not yet fully expanded into the eastern Mediterranean, a time when ideas that would influence Roman architecture and urban planning matured.  
  
Roman civilization is periodized into the Roman Kingdom (753-509 BC), the Roman Republic (510-27 BC), and the Roman Empire (27 BC - 395). The document also notes the preceding Etruscan Civilization and the Villanovan (1100-725 BC) and Oriental (725-580 BC) periods, followed by the Archaic (580-480 BC) and Classic (480-325 BC) periods before the Roman Republic.Symbolic Cities and Philosophical Foundations  
  
Both Athens and Rome are described as "symbolic cities" and cultural archetypes. The classical period of the Greek city is referred to as an "axial period," a time when fundamental changes in human thinking occurred, laying the foundations for modernity. Sociologist Shmeul N. Eisenstadt's perspective is introduced, stating that the Greek polis was the birthplace of the realization that man can make his own decisions and shape the world, rather than being subject to given circumstances. This marks the beginning of "multiple modernities," with the Western version becoming predominant.  
  
The emergence of Greek philosophy, connected to this modernity, saw figures like Plato (c. 427-347 BC) and Aristotle (384-322 BC) as founders of Western philosophy. They contemplated the "ideal city," its organization, and social groups, laying the foundation for a Greek utopian tradition in urbanism, as argued by Helen Rosenau. The Roman architectural theorist Vitruvius (80-15 BC) played a similar role in the Roman utopian tradition, searching for a city defined by harmony and regularity based on geometric shapes.  
  
Despite these utopian ideas, Greco-Roman cities were small in area and population. Rome, in 100 AD, was exceptional with an estimated population of 650,000, while others ranged from 200,000 (Ephesus) to 30,000 (Athens). A significant portion of these cities was dedicated to public buildings and monuments—35% in Pompeii and half of Rome.Architectural-Urban Typology  
  
The term "Greco-Roman city" is commonly used, suggesting continuity, but the models have both shared elements and crucial divergences. Their development can be traced back to the Minoan and Mycenaean "palace and castle cities." Minoan cities were a mixture of planning and organic growth, with streets dictated by topography, and often centered around a castle or citadel in a strategic location—the _Acropolis_ (the highest point of the city). While citadels lost military significance over time, the Acropolis remained central as a meeting place and residence of the gods. Early city growth was "cumulative" and "formless," with the term _labyrinth_ becoming associated with the confusing structure of Minoan settlements like Knossos. Mycenae was a fortified castle-town, with the citadel housing administrative and ceremonial spaces and surrounded by smaller settlements and tombs. The impressive citadel walls, made of dry masonry, were named _cyclopean constructions_ by later Greeks.  
  
The Mycenaean civilization's power waned with the invasion of nomadic tribes, leading to the Dark Ages (1200-800 BC). The Archaic period saw the rise of the _polis_, the sovereign city-state, an autonomous political entity where citizens held power. However, distinctions between citizens and non-citizens, free and slaves, remained, exemplified by Athens. Other city-states were described as a _timocracy_ (Sparta) or an _oligarchy_ (Corinth). Citizenship, reserved for adult men, was based on loyalty and the common good. The Greek polis was characterized by a distinction between _urbs_ (the physical city) and _civitas_ (the moral nexus of the citizens), with the latter being more important. Synoecism, the collective gathering of communities, formed the city-state, which included the city, surrounding villages (Attica peninsula), and the countryside (_chora_). Greek city-states also established colonies (_apoikia_) across the Mediterranean, such as Naples and Marseille, for food supply, trade, and to absorb overpopulation.The Greek Polis and the Agora  
  
The Classical period is considered the pinnacle of Greek architecture and urbanism, with Athens as an exemplary city. Public life was crucial, and architecture reflected this by defining the backdrop for political and public life. The _agora_ was the heart of the new city—an open square and public speaking place. Its evolution displaced the Acropolis as the city's most vital feature, accommodating political, economic, cultural, and religious activities, and promoting social cohesion. The agora was surrounded by _stoas_ (colonnades or galleries) offering shelter and serving as places for philosophical debate, teaching, and shops. Key government buildings, such as senate halls, were located nearby, making the agora a symbol of democracy and the rule of law.  
  
However, the text puts the idea of the polis as the beginning of democracy into perspective, noting that Greek society was based on natural inequality. Magistrates formed the top layer, while women and slaves were excluded from the agora and public life. Athenian women, in particular, had a very low status, classified as 'children' under Athenian law and often married young, making them legal property of men. Sparta offered a contrast, where women had status and power. Plato himself preferred an aristocratic government over a democratic one, believing the latter offered too much freedom.Public Buildings and Spaces in Greece  
  
The emphasis on public life meant great importance was attached to public space. The physical form of the city reflected this, with low, set-back homes and formally emphasized, large public buildings like temples, stadiums, and theaters. Domestic comfort was secondary, with most people living in simple, one-story dwellings clustered together with small, high windows and rooms grouped around an inner courtyard. The "urban fabric" was initially irregular, though later attempts were made at "rational urbanism."  
  
The ancient city was inseparable from religion. Greek religion was polytheistic, with temples being a priority. The typology of the temple, created during the Archaic period, was based on the Mycenaean _megaron_. Temples initially used wood, clay, and terracotta, with stone construction starting in the 6th century BC. The megaron shape was extended with front and rear galleries and a single or double colonnade (_peristyle_). The main architectural styles were the Doric, Ionic, and later, the Corinthian orders.  
  
The theater was another important element of public life. These were uncovered, semi-circular spaces with stepwise ascending benches, a fixed back wall (_skene_), and an altar at the center. Their location, often carved from hillsides, showed the Greeks' relationship between buildings and landscape, partly determined by natural acoustics and vistas. The _odeon_ or _odeum_ was a covered, semi-circular variant used for music and recitation.Classical Orders  
  
Ancient Greeks developed highly stylized treatments for bases, capitals, supported members, and entablatures, termed the _orders of architecture_ in the 16th century. Vitruvius, in _De Architectura_ (the only surviving written architectural treatise from antiquity), described three orders, roughly accompanying the three periods of Greek architecture:

- **Doric:** Sturdiest, based on the proportions of men, developed on mainland Greece. It has no base, a simple capital, a fluted shaft, and an entablature with a plain architrave and alternating _metopes_ (often with painting or sculpture) and _tryglyphs_ (vertically channeled tablets) in the frieze, crowned with a cornice.
- **Ionic:** Lighter, reflecting the proportions of women, developed on the Aegean islands. It has a base, a fluted column shaft, and a capital with _volutes_ (scrolls). Its entablature has an architrave and frieze.
- **Corinthian:** Slenderest, suggesting a young maiden, with a highly decorated, bell-shaped capital adorned with acanthus leaves, flowers, and scrolls, and an elaborate cornice. It emerged as a variation of the Ionic and was rarely used in Greek architecture.

These orders were specific yet flexible, adapted to circumstances, rather than being reduced to a single formula. They moved from the sober traditions of the Doric (mainland Greece) toward the freer, showier interpretations of the Ionic and Corinthian (associated with Asia Minor's coast).  
  
Beyond architecture, the Greeks emphasized a resolute body culture. The Olympic Games, dedicated to Zeus, began in 776 BC. The _gymnasium_, an important public facility, included rooms for gymnastics, running tracks, and pools. It was supported by collected taxes and considered vital for civil service and urban defense. It also served as a place for conversations and debates, and later became a school. The _stadium_ was an elongated, elliptical racecourse (approx. 185 meters) with seats for spectators. In Roman times, stadiums were used as a _hippodrome_ for horse racing and gladiator fights.The Roman Urbs: Grandeur and Pragmatism  
  
The Roman city is associated with grandeur, imposing architecture, rational urban planning, and civil engineering (e.g., aqueducts). However, the document notes its "dark side," with Lewis Mumford arguing the city itself remained a "shadow." Roman civilization absorbed many cultures (Etruscan, Greek, Egyptian) but produced a remarkably homogeneous architectural style with original forms like the triumphal arch. Romans were materialistic, practical, devoted to family, astute administrators, lawmakers, and competent builders. Their culture was derived mainly from Etruscan and Greek sources, but they were pragmatic, focused on legislation, military affairs, and technology, contrasting with the Greeks' focus on reflection and philosophy.  
  
Roman history is divided into the Kingdom (753-509 BC), Republic (510-27 BC), and Empire (27 BC-395). The Etruscans greatly influenced the Kingdom period, particularly in state structure, construction techniques (arches and vaults), trade, and religion. Etruscan cities were organized as city-states, and some argue Western urbanization basis can be found in them. Etruscan cities featured a grid plan with two main perpendicular streets, a structure the Romans later adopted for their military camps, the _castrum_.Roman Urban Planning and the Castrum  
  
Starting in the Republican period, Roman colonies were founded across the empire, based on the _castrum_ model and rational urban planning. This involved geodesy, precise land division, strict geometric principles, and religious perspectives. Agricultural legislation aimed to adequately divide territory into private and public land, leading to colonization. Colonies had a strategic military role in defending the empire. Land division was carried out by surveyors, with decisions made by a special commission of Roman magistrates. The territory was divided into grids (often roads) forming large squares or rectangles, which were then divided into individual lots (_pertica_). This rigid structure allowed for zoning, facilitated property administration, and tax collection. The land division was documented in a map, the _forma_, kept in Rome. The grid also provided the basis for infrastructure and accessibility.The Roman Forum  
  
The rise of the Roman Republic is compared to the Greek polis, but with a clearer distinction between the higher class, the _patricians_ (represented in the senate), and the lower class, the _plebeians_ (represented in the popular assembly).  
  
The _Forum_ was the Roman counterpart to the Greek Agora, functioning as an urban ensemble for administration, religion, justice, and trade. While commerce took a secondary role to civic and religious activities, it was the site for the storeroom of weights and measures, justice administration, public oratory, and public announcements. Specialized markets, like the Forum Boarium and the Forum Pescatorum, emerged as commercial activities were considered incompatible with the administrative core. The most famous was the **Forum Romanum**, the original center of Rome.  
  
Imperial forums, created during the Imperial period, were open-air museums of statues and monuments, celebrating the emperors' glory and triumphs, effectively appropriating the public domain. The Forum of Trajan (106-112) siphoned authority from the old Republican forum.  
  
The _Basilica_ was a crucial new typology invented by the Romans—a large assembly hall used for law courts and social/commercial gatherings, similar to the Greek stoa, but defining longitudinal central space with colonnades internally. The Basilica in Pompeii (c. 120-78 BC) is the oldest known.  
  
Roman temples, influenced by the Greeks, were likewise polytheistic. Distinctly Roman temples, such as the Temple of Jupiter in Pompeii and the Temple of Mars Ultor in Rome, were not isolated structures but axially approached buildings in urban settings, raised on _podiums_, accessed by a single flight of stairs, and often with a double row of columns atop. Some, like the Temple of Vesta in Tivoli, were circular, reflecting the Greek round _tholoi_, but used concrete and Corinthian ornamentation.  
  
The Pantheon in Rome (113-125) is the greatest circular plan temple. Its entrance is an enormous portico with twenty Corinthian columns (_prostyle_), awkwardly connecting the rectangular portico to the circular _cella_. The cella is covered by a dome with a central opening (_oculus_), letting in air and light. Converted to Christian use, the Pantheon remains the closest ancient Roman building to its original state.Greek vs. Roman Architecture  
  
The differences between Greek and Roman architecture and urbanism are rooted in their cultural differences. The Roman character sought order and world rule, while the Greek mind aimed for "amazement through intellectual discovery." Roman culture was pragmatic, focused on legislation, military, and technology—a culture of engineers. Greek art aimed to inspire through the embodiment of the sacred or beautiful, while Roman art communicated more objectively.  
  
Differences in structural organization are also noted. Greek buildings were independent; Roman buildings, while seen as sculpture, were grouped more deliberately. Heavy, square Roman pillars and arches replaced the Greek round, free-standing columns. Romans used thicker walls, half columns connected to the wall, and large barrel or groin vaults (the work of engineers) to span spaces, rather than flat ceilings.  
  
A major difference arose from the Romans' use of new building materials and techniques. They used fired bricks of cast material and _pozzolana_, a form of hydraulic cement derived from volcanic deposits, which hardened to a stone-like consistency even underwater. This engineering skill, utilizing elements operating in compression (arch, vault, dome), allowed for large, rapid, and economical construction, meeting the demands of the vast Empire.Classical Athens in Detail  
  
Athens, named after Athena, was the most important Greek city-state during the Classical period (500-336 BC). Its architecture and urbanism were secondary to its social organization—the city as a political and administrative, rather than purely residential, place. The first urban reflections were theoretical, speculating on the best form for the moral development of citizens. Aldo Rossi speculated that the extraordinary beauty of Greek cities' architecture might stem from this inherent intellectual character, embodying the passage from nature to culture. Thomas Gieryn associated Athens with "truth-spots," where truth is revealed, with the Acropolis and Agora forming such a place of divine and philosophical truth.  
  
Athens was a "transformation city," rebuilt after destruction by the Persians. Its urban development is sometimes typified as organic, but appears more as a collection of large artifacts lacking much structure. Placement of buildings, notably temples, might seem random but was influenced by a desire for logical sequences in an ordered universe, using surprise and shifts in perspective.  
  
The two main civic building groups were the **Acropolis** (political and religious center) and the **Agora** (civic and commercial core), connected by the **Panathenaic Way**.  
  
The **Acropolis** reconstruction began in 479 BC. It was a military, political, and religious center since Mycenaean times, and the original site of refuge, worship, and government. Buildings were carefully placed to respond to site qualities. Temples were mostly Eastwards oriented, and access was through the Western escarpment.

- **Parthenon** (447-432 BC): Designed by Iktinos and Kallikrates, dedicated to Athena Polias. The largest and most famous Greek temple, built with Pentelic Marble. Described as a Doric temple with Ionic attributes, combining a peripheral colonnade of Doric columns with a continuous sculpted Ionic frieze around the cella wall. Subtle adjustments (convex stylobate, inclined columns, larger/closer corner columns) corrected visual illusions. It housed a large cult statue of Athena. Its orientation allowed the sun to penetrate the cella on Athena's birthday. It was later reused as a Christian temple and a Mosque. In 1687, it was bombed by Venetians, and the remaining sculptures, the **Elgin Marbles**, were taken to England in the 19th century and are now in the British Museum.
- **Propylaea** (c. 437-432 BC): Monumental entrance gateway, designed by Mnesikles. A symmetrical entranceway in an asymmetrical setting, marking the transition from secular to sacred. Essentially a Doric Portico flanked by two projecting wings, one of which served as a picture gallery or banqueting hall.
- **Temple of Athena Nike** (Built c. 420 BC): Designed by Kallikrates. An early Ionic temple with four Ionic columns at the front and back, located on the edge of the hilltop. Its refined detailing made it a model for 18th-century garden temples.
- **Erechtheion** (421-406 BC): North of the Parthenon. One of the most inventive temples of classical antiquity, using the Ionic order to negotiate level differences and accommodate different sites of worship. It features the unique **Porch of the Caryatid maidens** (six female figures supporting the roof), which Vitruvius believed represented atonement for Caryae's alliance with the Persians. Its design influenced the later Corinthian order.

The arrangement on the Acropolis, though seemingly random, created a composition using surprise and changing perspective, with movement and procession as structuring elements.  
  
The **Agora** was the other fundamental urban space, developing around the Panathenaic Way from around 600 BC. Early public structures were built on the western side of the Agora Hill, including temples to Athena, Apollo, Ares, and Zeus, later replaced by the Stoa of Zeus (c. 425-410 BC) and the Doric Temple of Hephaestus (c. 449-415 BC). The Senate House, the Bouleterion (c. 500 BC), accommodated the 500 elected senators.  
  
The _stoa_ was the most important typology on the Agora, a roofed walkway with a double colonnade and a rear wall (often with rooms). It provided shelter and connected to the open space, serving as a place for trade and civic life. Examples include the Royal Stoa, the Painted Stoa (displaying military triumphs), and the South Stoa (used for commercial functions). Other buildings were the Heliaia (main law court) and the Tholos (circular building for senators' meals). The open areas were used for racetracks and performances. The Hellenistic period saw changes, creating a more complete spatial enclosure with buildings like the Stoa of Attalos (c. 159-134 BC).  
  
The **Panathenaic Way** was Athens' main thoroughfare, a sacred way connecting the city gate with the Acropolis, crossing the Agora diagonally. It was the route for the most important religious procession to the statue of Athena. Edmund Bacon argued that its constant use ingrained its religious association, making it the central organizing principle of Athenian architecture and urbanism, functioning as a system of regional movement. Bacon typified Greek architecture and urbanism at this time as "growth by accretion with space as connector," creating angular volumes of space between buildings to maintain coherence.Hippodamus' Rational Urbanism  
  
In contrast to Athens' organic growth was the port city of **Piraeus**, rebuilt in the Classical period with an orthogonal grid pattern inspired by **Hippodamus of Miletus** (498-408 BC), often regarded as the first urbanist. Hippodamus implemented the grid as a fundamental principle for urban development, consolidating religious, social, and commercial elements within orthogonal blocks adjusted to topography. The grid offered regularity and flexibility, accommodating the _agora_ easily.  
  
Hippodamus believed spatial planning was the basis for structuring society, seeing urban planning as a means to formally express a more rational social order. His ideal city of 10,000 citizens distinguished three population groups (artisans, farmers, warriors) and three land types (sacred, public, private). The size of the agora and theater were determined by population size. His redesign of Miletus also included a typical family house design based on the _megaron_. His influence led to the perfectly rectangular agora becoming the norm in the Hellenistic period, displacing the previous irregular plan. Edmund Bacon praised Hippodamus' model for introducing dynamic qualities (temples, gymnasia, stoas) as a counterpoint to the rigid grid.Imperial Rome and its Heritage  
  
The ancient city period is characterized by mythical and pagan religious thought, with Greeks emphasizing reflection and Romans focusing on legislation and engineering. Roman architecture and the city contributed to everyday activities, a "Greek city that had been brought back to earth," according to Michel Serres.  
  
The cultural-historical significance of Ancient Rome has been analyzed by theorists like Joseph Rykwert, who focused on the **symbolism and ritual foundation** of the city, referring to Rome as a palimpsest where the urban texture evokes its history, arguing that the foundation of Rome involved a murder (fratricide), which was repeated in the foundation of every subsequent Roman city. Aldo Rossi focused on the significance of architectural and urban design artifacts for the city's **collective memory**, introducing the concept of _locus_ (the relationship between a site and its buildings, at once specific and universal), associating it with _genius loci_ (the spirit of a place). Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter viewed Rome as a paradigm of urban planning as **bricolage** or a **collage city**, accommodating a whole range of "utopias in miniature," rejecting grand utopian visions of total planning.  
  
The presumed official founding of Rome was 753 BC by Romulus and Remus. The city developed on the seven hills of Rome, with the first settlement on the Palatine Hill. The location, near the curvature of the Tiber River and a ferry point, and the valley (later the Roman Forum) with a stream (later drained by the **Cloaca Maxima** sewer), were key topographical factors.  
  
The first phase, **Roma Quadrata**, referred to the city founded on the Palatine Hill according to Etruscan ritual, an alliance of settled tribes. The growth included the **Septimontium** (a ritual unity of people on a few hills) and the **Rome of Regiones Quattuor** (administrative-spatial districts).  
  
The **Servian (Republican) Wall** was built in 378 BC for protection, but fell into disrepair during the powerful Roman Empire. Triumphal arches replaced gates. The **Aurelian Walls** (271-275) were built later, under Emperor Aurelius, to protect Rome from barbarian attacks, utilizing existing structures.  
  
The **Campus Martius**, the counterpart of the _pomerium_ (sacred ground where no weapons were allowed), was a green plain stretching from the Roman Forum to the Tiber, originally for military exercises. It was redesigned by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa (27-25 BC) with temples, baths, and public gardens, expressing Rome's prosperity. Hadrian later transformed it. Buildings included the original Pantheon, baths, a stadium, and the Odeon.  
  
The **Forum Romanum** became the city's center, associating it with the _Umbilicus Urbis Romae_ (navel of the city) and the _Milliarum Aureum_ (indicating distances to major cities). The Rostra (podium for speeches) stood in front of the Curia (senate house). For Rossi, it was the prime example of _locus_ and _genius loci_. It reflected the Indo-European spirit as a threefold system (religious/secular power, military power, artisans). In the 5th century BC, it lost its marketplace function, becoming a public square filled with statues and monuments. The **Via Sacra** (or Sacra Via), the oldest road in Rome, ran through the Forum, important for processions. Julius Caesar (c. 46 BC) expanded the complex, and subsequent emperors continued to add colonnaded _fora_ dedicated to their glory.  
  
After the Great Fire of 64 under Nero, the city was rebuilt on a grand scale (_Nova Urbs_) with wide, straight streets, building codes, and construction using solid concrete and masonry for the _insulae_ (tenement houses) and imperial palaces. Nero built the Domus Aurea (Golden House) for himself. By the 4th century, Rome had an estimated population of over a million. The city's decline led Emperor Constantine to designate Constantinople as the new Rome. The ruins of monumental buildings kept the _locus_ of Rome alive as the "Eternal City."Roman Housing  
  
Roman housing is known mainly from excavations in Ostia. The two main typologies are the _domus_ and the _insula_.

- **Domus:** A private house with the _atrium_ as its central space, containing the _impluvium_ (water basin) for collecting water through a central roof opening. Rooms were arranged around the atrium, including the _tablinum_ (archive/office) and the _triclinium_ (dining room). A long corridor led to the atrium, flanked by rented _tabernae_ (retail spaces). A walled garden was in the back. A chapel for the house gods was in the open atrium.
- **Insula:** A multi-story house, up to six floors, a type of tenement barracks developed for common housing as the urban population increased. The ground floor consisted of shops and a courtyard. Apartments (_cenaculums_) were overcrowded, leading most people to spend their days in public buildings. Walls were initially timber and clay/mortar, but later brick and hydraulic cement were used. After the fire of 64, the insula became the predominant housing type, with 46,000 insulae against 1800 single-family houses in the 4th century.

Roman Legacy and the Transition to the Middle Ages  
  
The Roman Empire left its mark across Europe with a system of urban settlements connected by an elaborate road network, depicted in the **Tabula Peutingeriana**. The northern defensive border, the **Lower Germanic Limes**, ran through the Lower Countries along the Rhine.  
  
The _castrum_ was a typical Roman military settlement, organized in a strictly geometric square or rectangular area with an orthogonal street pattern, defined by the _via principalis_, _via quintana_, and the perpendicular _via decumana_ or _via praetoria_. Many medieval towns developed on these sites, retaining their regular layout (e.g., names with the suffix -chester in England).  
  
With the collapse of the Roman Empire, urban culture was replaced by small agricultural units, with the farming village (often a Frankish triangle layout) becoming the typical settlement. The period from the 9th to 13th century saw Charlemagne's attempt to revive Roman culture and the introduction of **feudalism**, a hierarchical system (nobility, clergy, peasantry) where military rulers controlled the land from fortified dwellings (castles).The Middle Ages (500 BCE to 400 CE onwards)  
  
A clear turning point in medieval urban development is identified in the **11th century** with the flourishing of **trade**. This led to a decisive break with feudalism as serfs became craftsmen and tradesmen. Trading settlements emerged at the intersections of roads and waterways, marking a renewed urbanization, both in existing Roman settlements and new foundations.  
  
By the Late Middle Ages (1300-1550), the urban morphology was shaped by trade and crafts. This was expressed by urban spaces for specialty markets and streets for specific crafts. Architectural elements included **guildhalls** (places to live and work), and infrastructure like docks, wharfs, and weigh houses. Religious life was also a crucial shaper, with **cathedrals, churches, cloisters, hospitals, and schools**. The third crucial function was **military**, with systems of defenses (tall walls) and armories. The urban fabric was thus shaped by commercial, religious, and military elements, recognizable in the market square, the cathedral's height, or the city walls.Two Approaches to Medieval Urban History  
  
Medieval urban history is understood through two diverging approaches:

1. **Continuity with Roman Civilization:** Medieval development builds on the Roman foundation but expands beyond it, reflecting increasing social, demographic, economic, and functional differentiation. As population increased, fortified settlements expanded, and city walls were enlarged. Cities became specialized centers of secondary and tertiary activities, competing on a broader level, creating a new urban system. This approach focuses on quantitative terms and the "traces" of Greek and Roman past.
2. **11th Century Turning Point:** Henri Pirenne and Max Weber argued for an entirely new kind of society that broke with feudalism and laid the foundation for Western-European culture.

**Henri Pirenne** identified the development of **long-distance trade** as the most important factor. Population growth led to an increase in people outside rural society (vagabonds, mercenaries, etc.) who turned to trade to survive. Traveling tradesmen banded together in associations called **guilds or hanse** for collective purchases and safety. Pirenne argued that these merchants needed permanent, safe bases for organizing their journeys (in winter), leading to the development of new urban centers at intersections of roads and waterways. Their success was determined by intelligence and initiative, not birth.  
  
**Max Weber** claimed that standard features were insufficient to define a town. The most significant parameter was the **visible adoption of a certain way of living** that differed from the rural pattern. This required:

- Economic development supported by crafts and trade.
- The presence of a market and a fortification.
- An **alliance of free citizens**.
- **Judicial and administrative autonomy** (independent legislation and administrators appointed by the population).

The capacity to develop new economic activity and occupations beyond land cultivation prompted the revival of urban culture, challenging and displacing existing societal systems.Typology and Morphology of Medieval Towns  
  
Urban development historian A.E.J. Morris categorized medieval towns into:

1. **Developed Towns (Organically Grown):** Of Roman origin, other fortified towns that acquired a commercial function, and towns developed from rural villages.
2. **Planned Towns (Established during the period):** Fortified _bastide_ towns (France, England, Wales) and other towns founded with or without a pre-established plan.

The main distinction is between the **(organically) 'developed town'** (irregular urban organization) and the **'planned town'** (regular urban organization).  
  
The roots of settlements were at strategic locations (fortresses, fortified monasteries) connected to transport infrastructure. Urban morphology was determined by local topographical elements. Trade and crafts developed around the fortifications, often outside the settlement walls, forming a **civil town**. This only later merged with the fortress, often signaled by a new wall around both areas, sharpening the distinction between urban and rural.  
  
The built area gained stability between 1300 and 1500, developing as a permanent structure with streets, alleys, and squares lined with buildings. The street layout was still implanted on the previous rural settlement. Construction used stone foundations (or piles), strongly influenced by soil conditions and available materials.Urban Components of Medieval Towns

- **Fortification/Stronghold:** Fortresses and castles, the ruler's center of authority, administration, and military power, built at the most strategic location (high point or river fork). Initially independent, they were later integrated into the city walls as a 'corner stone.'
- **Defensive System:** Comprised of a fortress and a wall. Walls evolved from simple earthen walls to heavy, stone walls with moats, city gates (specialized architectural elements), and defense towers, due to the evolution of war techniques (including artillery).
- **Civil Town:** The settlement developed by tradesmen and craftsmen in the shadow of the fortress, in a symbiotic relationship (market and refuge). Tension arose as the civil town gained economic force and called for self-rule. The fortress eventually became part of the town's defense system.
- **Market:** The economic and social center, commonly located in or near a central space, often at the intersection of trade routes or unloading areas (waterways). Infrastructure like meeting halls and weigh houses concentrated here. The term 'market' also symbolized the town's _raison d'etre_ (trade), which occurred throughout the town, often in a widened main street, on bridges, and along canals.
- **Urban Fabric (Streets and Canals):** Described as an intricate web or labyrinth of narrow, busy, and often dirty streets where a great deal of urban activity took place. The street functioned as a yard and a semi-public transition area for trade. Canals, initially deepened ditches, were later improved with quay walls and sometimes used for building. The **portus** (first port area) often had an even more irregular, small-scale street pattern.
- **Organic/Urban Tissue Metaphor:** The disordered arrangement of medieval streets is often compared to a **biological organism** (e.g., Bruges) or **urban tissue**, where small-scale building (**basic cells**) renewed itself, forming the fine-grained structure of the street plan.

The Plan of Saint Gall  
  
A communal form of monasticism became a predominant social and architectural model in the Middle Ages. The **Plan of Saint Gall** is the oldest surviving architectural drawing from the medieval period, produced in 817, detailing a model layout for a self-sufficient Benedictine abbey for approximately 110 monks, following the flexible Rule of St. Benedict.  
  
The largest building was the **church**, a double-ended Basilica with masonry walls, timber truss roofs, and twin cylindrical towers. The **cloister**, located south of the church, was a courtyard with a covered, arcade walk connecting major buildings: the chapter house, workroom, and warming room (below the dormitory) on the east; the refectory (dining hall) on the south; the cellar and storeroom on the west; and the church on the north. External service buildings included the bakery, brew house, workshops, and a working farm. The monastery also featured a double cloister for the novitiate and infirmary, a house for physicians, a medicinal herb garden, a cemetery, the abbot's house, an external school, and a guesthouse/stables for high-ranking visitors.  
  
The plan demonstrates the high quality of functional planning by Carolingian architects and established a model for monastic design for over 400 years, although no built monastery followed it precisely.
