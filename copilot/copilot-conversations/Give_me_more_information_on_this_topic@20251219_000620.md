**ai**: The note [[4. The High line]] describes the High Line in New York, an elevated freight track built in the 1930s that was abandoned by the 1980s. Its redevelopment as a park is highlighted as a groundbreaking strategy that fuses nature with the built environment through a concept called "agri-tecture." This involves a design that blends paving and planting units, allowing for natural growth through open joints in the concrete planks. The project is also noted for its role in the economic and social revitalization of the area, serving as a landmark and a mechanism for placemaking. The note suggests that these redevelopment strategies could be applied to a temporary structure, hinting at a permanent state.
