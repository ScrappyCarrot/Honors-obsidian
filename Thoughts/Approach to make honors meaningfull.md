We have to set a measurable goal for ourselves. 
get in contact with the guy and get his presentation. Analyze all the documents possible and IDENTIFY KEY WEAKNESS in the plan. Based on that generate solution that is modular and addaptable to the possible outcomes we foresee. Around sept2026 start making a prototype based on 3 study cases and towards q3y3 present our findings to the municipality to try to get this implemented.

1. Gather info
2. Idenfity weakness
3. Informed decision
4. Check with all the regulations
5. Make prototype
6. Get in touch with municipality and try to implement
7. Success???? (if this goes well a student team can be implemented to help the municipality long term and build off of our project)
