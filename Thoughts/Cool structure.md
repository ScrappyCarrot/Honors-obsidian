Would be cool to have a structure that isn't restricted by what kind of beams we use.
It would be relatively easy to integrate different profiles, but different member lengths would be harder.
Maybe we can make a bolted connections that act as hinges, two plated on each side of the member, thus we can use members that are longer than needed. Also use extenders in case they are not long enough (this would have to be calculated thoroughly)
