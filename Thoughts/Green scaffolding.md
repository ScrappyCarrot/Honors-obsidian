### 6. "Green" Scaffolding (General Concept)

**Concept:** A rising trend in urban renovation where construction scaffolding is used as a temporary vertical garden rather than an eyesore.

- **Example:** The **"Living Wall" scaffolds** (often seen in high-end developments in London or Paris) where the safety netting is replaced or supplemented with temporary planters or pre-grown ivy screens. This transforms the construction site into a temporary vertical park, filtering dust and noise while providing aesthetic value during the renovation period.
