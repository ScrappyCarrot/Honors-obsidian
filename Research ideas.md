- [ ] Check with the KLIC-melding: this will show us where the cables/pipes and such are to know how we can position our structure (11EUR)
- [ ] Pedestrian flow analysis (somehow get the data for this)
- [ ] CROW 96b richtlijnen voor voetgangers- this is the bible of roadworks
- [ ] Connecitons (parametric connections in grasshopper) 
- [ ] Subsurface data+ geotechnical standards in Eurocode (understand the basics at least)
- [ ] Look into permits and the A.P.V. scheme-Tijdelijk gebruik openbare ruimte Eindhoven(fee structures)
- [ ] **CPTED (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design)**

- [ ] KCAP wants to make the station have a second ground. We can incorporate some elements that would hint to this as the future of the development
- [ ] [[Research math papers (Black Maria)|Research math papers (Black Maria)]] to understand modularity principle
